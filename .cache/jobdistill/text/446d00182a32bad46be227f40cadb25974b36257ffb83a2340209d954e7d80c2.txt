We're a hybrid company, with of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration. Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada's top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights. Today's renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data- driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.

We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don't listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company. • Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact. • Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren't satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don't take someone's word for it or the answer "because that's how we do it." Understand why and dig deep. • Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email. • Act like an owner. We're all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term. • Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated. Diversity and Inclusion Quandri is dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. As an equal opportunity employer, Quandri adheres to Canadian labour laws and does not engage in discrimination based on race, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, disability, age, or any other status protected under Canadian law.
