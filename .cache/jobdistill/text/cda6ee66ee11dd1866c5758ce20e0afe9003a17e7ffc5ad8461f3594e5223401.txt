We provide alternatives to the fee-for-service method of paying physicians. The Alternative Payments program aims to secure sufficient access to care in situations where fee-for-service arrangements may not guarantee physicians the financial support or stability to be able to provide needed care. Examples include teaching hospitals, community and hospital-based psychiatric services, and physician services in rural areas. Service agreements are one of the alternative funding methods that our team supports. A service agreement is a contract between the Ministry of Health and a health authority or similar agency, which enables that organization to retain the required physicians through contract, direct employment or some other negotiated arrangement. The APP team supports health authorities in their contract negotiations with physicians, and validates and reimburses health authorities for alternative payments to physicians.
