About the Energy, Environment and Climate Change (EECC) Department The EECC Department leads Island Health's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts across our buildings, operations, materials, water, and transportation systems. Our award winning department is made up of two complementary programs: • Environmental Sustainability Program Drives environmentally sustainable healthcare through innovative clinical, operational, and organizational practices. • Energy Program Develops and implements projects that reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions across our facilities. Role Summary: Come support the future of smart, sustainable Buildings. Thanks to funding from BC Hydro, we're excited to offer a Co-op Student Position to support our Continuous Optimization Program, a key pillar of our Energy Program. This role focuses on scaling up our cutting-edge Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) initiative, which uses real- time building data to drive actionable insights. This is more than a co-op-it's a chance to be part of a mission-driven team that's shaping the future of sustainable healthcare. If you're passionate about climate action, data, and smart buildings, we'd love to hear from you.
