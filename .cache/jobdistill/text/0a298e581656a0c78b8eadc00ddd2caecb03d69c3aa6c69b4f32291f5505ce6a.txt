Job Summary: TripSpark is searching for an Engineering or Computer Science internship student for a 16-month term to work on our new fixed- route in-vehicle solution. If you are eager to learn, love programming, and aren't afraid to try new things, this is the role for you. During your internship, experienced developers will support you, ensuring you acquire the necessary skills to work on mission-critical features. You'll be involved in the full development cycle, from design and implementation to testing and support. Unlike some other companies who assign their internship students mundane tasks, we give ours almost identical responsibilities to fulltime junior developers. Additionally, we host regular junior developer meetups, providing you with opportunities to collaborate with other junior developers. You'll work on programming challenges, discuss best practices, and share stories about how you've overcome tricky problems. As part of this role, you'll have the opportunity to participate in a once-a-year remote hackathon trip. During this event, we code with enthusiasm, indulge in delicious food, and engage in late-night gaming sessions. Additionally, our Calgary office location offers free parking, a quality coffee machine, and an abundance of snacks to keep you energized throughout the day. At TripSpark, we provide a flexible working environment that allows employees to choose between working in the office or from home. Job Description: What we are looking for • You are completing a post-secondary degree in Computer Science or Engineering at an accredited University/College with a 16- month internship program. • You have a strong programming background in C# or C++. • You have a natural curiosity and eagerness to learn new things • You have good oral and written communication skills. • You are a good active listener who is willing to challenge assumptions with honesty, a cool head, and a spirit of cooperation. • You display a willingness to take ownership of tasks and be accountable for project success and timelines. • You have strong time management skills. • Nice to have - experience working with hardware. Your Responsibilities You will be working in an agile programming environment with a team to complete features for our fixed-route in-vehicle solution in a .NET environment. Our team usually works in two-week sprints with daily scrums to track progress. You will be expected to participate in design reviews, sprint planning, and retrospectives with your team to ensure that features can be delivered on time with high quality. All major features are code reviewed and cross tested by teammates regardless of experience level so the team can learn from each other. In addition to learning how to write good maintainable code, you will also be responsible for writing design specifications, customer-facing feature notes, and presenting your work in demos.
