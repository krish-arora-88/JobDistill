Backed by VC funding and we've been recognized with the 2025 Frost & Sullivan Technology Innovation Leadership Award, the AAM Supplier Excellence Innovation Award, and the 2024 BC Tech "Company of the Year - Growth", we are on a mission to redefine the future of AI-driven robotic vision systems. Apera AI helps manufacturers make their factories more flexible and productive. Robots enhanced with Apera's software have 4D Vision - the ability to see and handle objects with human-like capability. Challenging applications such as bin picking, sorting, packaging, and assembly are now open to fast, precise, and reliable automation. Apera is led by an experienced team from high-growth companies focused on robotics, artificial intelligence, and advanced manufacturing. Role Overview: We're looking for a Software Developer, Cloud Infrastructure (Co-Op) who is excited to learn how modern cloud platforms support AI-driven robotics systems. In this role, you'll work alongside experienced engineers to help build and improve the cloud services that power our vision-guided robots, gaining hands-on experience with real production systems in a supportive, fast- learning environment. This is an opportunity to apply what you've learned in school to real-world infrastructure challenges, while developing practical skills in cloud engineering, DevOps, and distributed systems. This role is based in person at our Vancouver office and is an 8-month co- op term. What You'll Do: • Build and improve cloud services: Contribute to scalable cloud services running on AWS or GCP. Learn how infrastructure is defined using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and help implement improvements to existing systems. • Work with data and telemetry: Help develop or maintain systems that ingest, store, and expose telemetry from robotic and vision systems, enabling teams to monitor performance and diagnose issues. • Learn reliability and observability practices: Support efforts to instrument services with logging and metrics. Learn how teams think about uptime, monitoring, and safe system changes. • Apply secure engineering principles: Work with senior engineers to understand access control, secrets management, and secure-by-design cloud infrastructure. • Collaborate across teams: Partner with Robotics, Vision, and Software teams to understand how cloud systems support real- world robot deployments. What You'll Learn: • How production cloud infrastructure supports AI and robotics systems • Practical use of Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CDK, or similar) • Observability, reliability, and secure system design How cross-functional teams ship and operate complex systems • Why This Co-Op Is a Great Experience: • Real impact, real systems: Your work will support systems used in real factories and not toy projects or internal demos. • Strong mentorship: You'll work closely with experienced engineers who provide guidance, feedback, and learning opportunities. • Exposure to cutting-edge technology: Robotics, AI, computer vision, and cloud infrastructure all intersect here. Growth-focused environment: We value curiosity, learning, and thoughtful problem solving over knowing everything on day one. • Job Requirements What We're Looking For: • Currently enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's program in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field • Coursework or project experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or similar) • Programming experience in at least one language (e.g., Python, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript) • Familiarity with Git and basic software development workflows • Interest in distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps.
