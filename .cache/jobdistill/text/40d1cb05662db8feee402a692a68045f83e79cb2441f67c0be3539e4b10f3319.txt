You'll help design AI systems that reason over complex, multimodal design problems - integrating spatial, quantitative, textual, and procedural knowledge - to make the built world smarter, safer, and more sustainable. Our team combines expertise in machine learning, computational design, simulation, and AEC workflows. This project focuses on developing methods for structured reasoning and collaboration among AI agents, inspired by how human experts coordinate across design, engineering, and planning tasks. The goal is to advance AI systems that can analyze, critique, and generate design alternatives grounded in real-world AEC contexts. Autodesk's AI Lab actively publishes at NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, and CVPR, and collaborates with leading academic and industry partners. Interns join a vibrant research community combining academic freedom with direct product impact. Responsibilities • Develop and execute a research agenda focused on advancing AI reasoning and multimodal learning in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) • Create and refine cutting-edge algorithms, drawing from multiple aproaches in artificial intelligence • Collaborate with researchers and engineers across diverse disciplines, including communicating research plans, progress, and results • Explore methods for structured reasoning and collaborative problem-solving among intelligent systems • Shape the future of Autodesk's architecture, engineering, and construction products through published research and practical applications #LI-HY1 Learn More About Autodesk Welcome to Autodesk!
