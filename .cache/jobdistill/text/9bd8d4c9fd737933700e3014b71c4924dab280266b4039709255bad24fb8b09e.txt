The NRC/ Aquatic and Crop Resource Development Research Centre The National Research Council (NRC) is the Government of Canada's largest research organization supporting industrial innovation, the advancement of knowledge and technology development. It represents a powerful partnering option for anyone looking to push the boundaries of science and industry. The NRC's Aquatic and Crop Resource Development Research Centre (ACRD) performs advanced scientific research and provides research services and technology development for the sustainable transformation of Canadian bio-based resources into higher-value products. Our crop-based research focuses on ensuring a diverse and sustainable supply of resources for the Canadian agriculture and food ecosystem. Towards crop resource development, we are developing advanced tools and technologies to: • Increase the productivity, resilience and sustainability of traditional and economically important crops for Canada. • Optimize the production of plant-based protein ingredients. Advance data-driven and AI-ML solutions for Canada's agriculture and food strategies. • Your Challenge As a student joining NRC-ACRD, you will undertake career-related projects in an engaging and intellectually-stimulating environment working alongside leading scientists who are passionate about the betterment of our agriculture and food systems. Our Integrated Omics and Climate Resilience (IOCR) team is dedicated to understanding the molecular mechanisms of stress to facilitate the development of crops with enhanced productivity and resilience. Using a number of high-throughput imaging platforms, the IOCR team generates a large number of crop images which are predominantly stored in separate locations across different servers and users. The successful student will make important contributions to the management, stewardship, and democratization of crop research data through the creation of a new online tool that will help ACRD researchers store, organize, and locate their project images more easily. This web-based service, providing secure, privilege-based, authorized access, will allow users to upload images, add metadata and tags, and search for them using keywords, facilitating reuse of research results in alignment with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.
