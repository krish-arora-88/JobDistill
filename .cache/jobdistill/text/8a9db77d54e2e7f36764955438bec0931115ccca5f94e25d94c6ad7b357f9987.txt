This position offers a unique opportunity to contribute directly to biologically driven, hypothesis-focused computational research using large-scale multi-omics datasets, including both bulk and single-cell modalities. This role centers on custom, exploratory, and mechanistic data interrogation to advance our understanding of gene regulation in blood cancer. The Co-Op will work closely with basic science and clinical research teams to design, execute, and interpret analyses, and to support the experimental validation of computational findings. This is an excellent opportunity for students excited about applying computational and life sciences training to collaborative biological discovery. Key Responsibilities Perform bespoke multi-omics analyses (bulk and single-cell • epigenomics, transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, etc.) to support hypothesis generation and testing. • Integrate and analyze diverse datasets (e.g., ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, multi-modal single-cell datasets) to uncover regulatory mechanisms. • Collaborate closely with bench scientists and clinicians to refine biological questions, interpret results, and guide validation studies. • Develop custom computational approaches and analytical workflows using existing tools and frameworks (e.g., Python, R, CWL, Docker/Singularity). • Apply rigorous QC, exploratory analysis, and data visualization to derive biological insights from complex datasets. • Document analysis strategies, parameters, and findings to ensure reproducibility and scientific rigor. • Participate in lab meetings and cross-functional discussions, presenting analytical results and contributing to scientific problem- solving. Benefits & Learning Outcomes Hands-on experience performing biologically driven analysis on real- • world, large-scale multi-omics datasets. • Experience with both bulk and single-cell analytic frameworks and cutting-edge epigenomics technologies. • Opportunities to contribute to mechanistic studies and translational research efforts. • Work within a highly multidisciplinary environment, collaborating with computational biologists, molecular biologists, and clinicians. • Build skills in scientific communication, hypothesis development, and integrative data interpretation. Pay transparency in B.C. - Province of British Columbia (gov.bc.ca) 3,250 per month plus 4% vacation pay Job Requirements Preferred Qualifications: Enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's program in Bioinformatics, • Computational Biology, Genomics, Computer Science, or a related field. • Experience with epigenomic and/or transcriptomic data analysis (bulk or single-cell) is a plus. • Familiarity with workflow languages or frameworks (e.g., CWL, WDL, Nextflow, Snakemake) and containerized environments (Docker, Singularity). • Understanding of common genomic data formats (FASTQ, BAM, VCF, BED) and QC concepts. • Exposure to cloud computing platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and Linux/Unix computing environments. • Experience with Python, R, or similar languages for exploratory and statistical analysis. • Strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills, with an interest in biological discovery.
