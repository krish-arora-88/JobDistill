The position start date is May 2026. The successful applicant will gain valuable experience in data screening, data linkage, preparing analytic data sets, selecting and implementing appropriate statistical methodologies, creating compelling data visualizations, and communicating scientific results. We have a few ongoing projects in the lab. One potential project is entitled "Reducing harms associated with 'before medical advised' (BMA) hospital discharge", that seeks to reduce the risks of adverse events (such as emergency department visit, unplanned readmission, drug overdose, death) that are linked with BMA discharges. This project examines the trends in BMA discharge and the harms associated with BMA discharge over the last two decades in British Columbia using population-based linked administrative health datasets. We also evaluate whether specific post-discharge interventions (e.g., early outpatient clinician follow-up, return to hospital, outpatient prescription medication fills) can reduce these harms after BMA discharge, using cohort study designs and cutting-edge target trial emulation techniques. Using microsimulation models, we will model the absolute and relative reductions in population-level harms that might be achieved by scaling up promising clinical interventions. In another project, we will use data available at the time of hospital admission to predict the risk of BMA discharge. Prior experience of developing clinical risk prediction models will be an asset. Our overarching goal with these projects is to inform the clinical and public health response on the adverse events linked with BMA discharge, including its impact on the accelerating opioid overdose crisis. The successful applicant will be supervised by study Principal Investigator (PI) Dr. John A Staples MD FRCPC MPH, a Clinical Associate Professor in the UBC Department of Medicine. The successful candidate should be able to work independently, collaborate with other members of the Staples Lab and with the affiliated UBC Road Safety Research Team, and communicate clearly and concisely in written and oral form. The successful applicant must work in accordance with UBC's scholarly integrity policies and practice data integrity.

Intentional or unintentional breaches of privacy and confidentiality may result in study termination, loss of study funding, or termination of employment and may prompt an administrative or criminal investigation.
