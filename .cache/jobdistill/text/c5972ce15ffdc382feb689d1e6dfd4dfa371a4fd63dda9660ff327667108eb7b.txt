It was through my Co-ops that I learned just how passionate I am about computer programming and automated software testing. Working in my role I was able to make significant contributions to the automated testing framework and increase test coverage. I was able to see the positive impacts of my work and how and it benefited my team and the corporation. Deciding that I wanted to continue with a career path in automated software testing, I was hired full time as an Intermediate Test Automation Developer after completing my degree in Computer Science at the University of Victoria. I have continued working here ever since and have obtained a position as a Senior Test Automation Developer. I strongly recommend a Co-op at BC Pension Corporation as a Test Automation Developer, especially if you are looking to develop your computer programming skillset." - Dallas, Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) and UVIC Graduate 2019 "During my time at the BC Pension Corporation, I completed three Co-op semesters with the Test Automation team. My experiences during these Co-ops helped me realize that Test Automation is an area of software development that I have a particular interest in. I was responsible for helping to create and expand test coverage on a wide range of applications. This allowed me an amazing opportunity feel the direct impact of my work with each step of development and find enjoyment in the range of required issues to explore and solve. Throughout my Co-ops I also got to experience the incredible work and support of the BC Pensions Co-op team. They provided truly unique opportunities for both personal and professional development and helped to build a feeling of community. By the end of my Co-ops, I found that Test Automation at BC Pension was career that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to explore. I was hired to a permanent position as an Intermediate Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) in December 2023 and am excited to continuing my career here." - Jesse, Intermediate Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) and UVIC Graduate 2024 Diversity & Inclusion BC Pension Corporation is an equal opportunity employer committed to establishing an inclusive, equitable, and accessible environment for all.
