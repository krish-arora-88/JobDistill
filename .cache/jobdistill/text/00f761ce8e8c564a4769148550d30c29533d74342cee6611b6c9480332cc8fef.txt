Project Description We are developing a content-based search system in the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) that will enable users to search astronomical images not only by metadata but also by image content. Our AI deep learning models, currently being tested on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, will enable users to select and download scientific images based on their content (e.g., spiral or elliptical galaxies) or filter out images affected by artifacts or poor quality (e.g., cosmic rays). To make these models practical tools, CADC is seeking a student to contribute to their integration into the data centre. The initial focus will be deployment in the HST collection, with future extensions to other archives such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The student will work on understanding model functionality, supporting the implementation of models into CADC systems, and conducting experiments related to AI-driven content-based search and CAOM (Common Archive Observation Model) applications. Length of term This is a «16 week» term. Anticipated dates: starting 5 January 2026, ending 24 April 2026. Responsibilities • Assist with the integration of AI/deep learning models into CADC systems. • Conduct experiments to evaluate and improve content-based search methods. • Work with image datasets (e.g., HST) and identify opportunities for quality control and categorization. • Contribute to the implementation of pipelines for deployment in the CADC environment. Document processes and outcomes to support future extensions to additional archives (e.g., JWST). • Compensation • From $833 to $1107 per week (37.5 hrs) Salaries are determined based on the student's work term. • Notes • In 2025, the NRC has been chosen as one of Canada's Top Employers for Young People, the National Capital Region's Top Employers and Forbes Canada's Best Employers. • The incumbent must adhere to safe workplace practices at all times. • A driver's license and car would be useful for personal transportation.
