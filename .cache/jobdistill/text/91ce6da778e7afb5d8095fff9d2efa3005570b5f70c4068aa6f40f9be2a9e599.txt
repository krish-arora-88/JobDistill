Possible Projects We don't have time for busy work: every project that we do has customers clamoring for it. Along with quick release cycles and an engineer-oriented culture means we always have a slew of interesting projects to tackle. What project you'll work on at Arista will vary a lot depending on our customer demands and your interests. Here are some potential projects: 1. Internal Builds/Tests Dashboard Arista maintains an extensive automated build and autotest system. Hundreds of builds and thousands of tests are run every day. The results of these tests are collected in a database, and we have a web-based "dashboard" app that is used to display the results of the builds and autotest runs. We are currently developing a completely new version of this dashboard with the latest JavaScript tools, including ReactJS, NuclearJS (flux), D3, Webpack and the Babel ES6 compiler. 2. Tap Aggregation Configuration & Monitoring System Arista has developed a system that allows customers to run a switch in "tap aggregation" mode. This provides customers with the ability to select incoming traffic on Ethernet ports according to several rules (e.g., IP address patterns, protocol IDs, etc.), and redirect (or "tap") that traffic to specific output Ethernet ports. On the other end of the output ports are "tools" such as virus scanners, bandwidth/usage monitors, intrusion detection systems and more. The web application for configuring and monitoring the switch, called the Tap Aggregation Manager, allows users to visualize the connections between all the ports to better understand how data is flowing through the switch. The Tap Aggregation Manager is an AngularJS app using Bootstrap, with Gulp as the build system. We are looking to add several new features to this app. 3. Other Internal Web Dev Projects Arista has several other internal web-based tools that are in need of rewriting. These would use technologies including: • ReactJS • Redux • D3 More Info You can find out more information about Arista on our website at www.arista.com or about our internship program at jobs.arista.com/university and at jobs.arista.com N/A Citizenship Requirement Position Start Date Position End Date May 05, 2025 12:00 AM August 29, 2025 12:00 AM APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Cover Letter Required?
