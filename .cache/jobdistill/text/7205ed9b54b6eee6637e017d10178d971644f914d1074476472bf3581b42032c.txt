This is not a typical placement-you'll join a small, interdisciplinary team of mechanical, electrical, and software/embedded systems students tackling a focused R&D challenge. Think of it as an in-house capstone project or skunkworks: you'll be expected to dive deep into research, experiment with prototypes, and push the boundaries of our award-winning technology toward new applications. If you're self-motivated, hands-on, and excited by the chance to explore and create, this is the opportunity for you. Who we are: We are a passionate and fun group of people, working hard to bring innovation to the baby industry. As two of our co founders became new parents the idea was born to innovate one essential piece of equipment - the baby stroller. Bringing together Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Software Development and Product Design, Glüxkind offers a wide range of opportunities. Combining all these disciplines, our goal is to build an autonomous stroller that will keep babies safe, and in turn their parents happy. We're looking for the brightest minds to join us on this incredible journey along the sidewalks of this world, in the pursuit of bringing safety to parents and their little ones. What you'll be getting up to: At Glüxkind, we really believe that a great team is everything, and our Embedded Systems Engineers are an important part of our growing team; providing the right mix of team player and problem solver, and programming. Our Engineers will be directly responsible for helping our hardware and software team to thrive and advance our technology through a mix of collaboration and independent work. Together we want to build a safer future for babies and achieve peace of mind for new parents. A highly successful Coop student looks something like this: • Excited to build a global success story with us, from the very beginning. Working for a start-up requires flexibility, resilience, and resourcefulness. • You understand that people are everything. You're collaborative, optimistic and you listen to understand, demonstrating kindness and empathy in all interactions. • You're not satisfied with "good enough" (just like parents when they are shopping for their newborns) • You love to experiment, try new things, and drive improvements. • It's not enough for you to know the what - you need to know the why! You are energized by challenging problems and are persistent/resourceful in your efforts to solve them. • You are highly motivated, proactive, comfortable with change and ambiguity. • You have a humble, team-player attitude and are ready to pitch in wherever you are needed most. You are well articulated, your phone/virtual and written presence conveys confidence and charm. • Why Join Us At Glüxkind, you won't just be another co-op-you'll be part of a startup team that values initiative, creativity, and hands-on problem solving. You'll have ownership over a real R&D project with the freedom to explore, experiment, and make an impact. Think of it as your chance to tackle an ambitious in-house capstone with direct mentorship from industry professionals, all while contributing to award-winning technology. If you're excited by the idea of working in a fast-paced, collaborative environment where curiosity and initiative are celebrated, we'd love to have you on our team.
