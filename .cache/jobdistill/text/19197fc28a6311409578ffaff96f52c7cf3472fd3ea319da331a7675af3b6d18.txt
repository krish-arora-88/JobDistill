Please note we will only be interviewing candidates from these post-secondary institutions. The role is a fixed-term contract starting May 4th and ending Aug 28th. About the Role: We are looking for an engineering candidate who can build, train, and optimize deep learning models in Tensorflow, and deploy them for high-performance inference on Google Tensor / ASIC-based environments. Beyond model training, you'll also be hands-on in developing tools for image manipulation, and augmentation in a microservices architectural. Applications will be built in Python, PHP, C#, Flutter, and even Excel (VBA/macros) for internal tools and automation. Main Role Functions: AI / Machine Learning (Core) • Design, build, and train deep learning models using TensorFlow (and Keras where appropriate). • Prepare and preprocess datasets (cleaning, augmentation, feature engineering). • Optimize models for inference on Google Tensor / TPU / Google Cloud ML infrastructure (quantization, pruning, model conversion, etc.). Implement and manage microservices pipelines (REST APIs, batch inference, on-device inference where applicable). • Application Integration (Python, PHP, C#, Flutter) • Build backend services in Python and/or PHP to expose model predictions via APIs. • Integrate AI functionality into C# applications (e.g., desktop apps, services, or back-office tools). • Develop and maintain Flutter front-end/mobile apps that consume AI APIs and display results in a user-friendly way. Collaborate with front-end and full-stack developers to align API design, data contracts, and performance constraints. • Automation & Reporting (Excel / Macros) • Create and maintain Excel tools and dashboards that connect to AI services or process model outputs. Write and optimize Excel VBA/macros to automate data preparation, reporting, and simple analytics workflows. • Collaboration & Documentation • Work closely with product owners, domain experts, and other engineers to translate business problems into ML solutions. • Document model architectures, data pipelines, APIs, and deployment procedures with clear, maintainable technical writing. • Prepare and support electrical planning reports and technical documentation under the guidance and review of a Professional Engineer (P.Eng), ensuring compliance with engineering standards, safety considerations, and regulatory requirements.
