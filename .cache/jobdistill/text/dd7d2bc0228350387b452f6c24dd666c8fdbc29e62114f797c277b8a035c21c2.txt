With AI redefining the computing paradigm, solutions must evolve to unify innovations in software models, compilers, platforms, networking, and semiconductors. Our diverse team of technologists have developed a high performance RISC-V CPU from scratch, and share a passion for AI and a deep desire to build the best AI platform possible. We value collaboration, curiosity, and a commitment to solving hard problems. We are growing our team and looking for contributors of all seniorities. As an intern in the Physical Design (PD) team, you will work on high-performance designs going into industry leading AI/ML architectures. The student coming into this role will develop ML-based tools and flows to improve the PPA (Performance Power Area) and turnaround time for all aspects of chip implementation from synthesis to tapeout for various IPs. The work is done collaboratively with a group of highly experienced engineers across various domains of the ASIC. This role is on-site, hybrid, based out of Santa Clara, CA working 4 days in office, 1 day remote. What You Will Learn • How to apply ML systems and flows to high-performance designs for industry-leading AI/ML architectures. • Practical experience in extending existing ML systems and implementing cutting-edge algorithms. • Gain exposure to core physical design fundamentals, including synthesis, place and route, and timing analysis. Experience collaborating with a group of highly experienced engineers across various domains of the ASIC implementation. • Compensation for all interns at Tenstorrent ranges from $50/hr - $70/hr including base and variable compensation targets. Experience, skills, education, background and location all impact the actual offer made. Tenstorrent offers a highly competitive compensation package and benefits, and we are an equal opportunity employer.
