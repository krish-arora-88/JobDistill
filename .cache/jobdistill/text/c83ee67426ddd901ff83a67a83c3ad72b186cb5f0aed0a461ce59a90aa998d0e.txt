To achieve this, we've built custom silicon (AWS Inferentia and Trainium) and the AWS Neuron SDK that together deliver high-performance, cost-effective machine learning in the cloud. The AWS Neuron SDK includes a compiler, runtime, debugger, and libraries integrated with popular frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. It is preinstalled in AWS Deep Learning AMIs and Containers so customers can quickly get started with training and inference on AWS ML accelerators. The Neuron Toronto team focuses on performance, kernels, and tooling-analyzing and optimizing end-to-end ML workloads, developing and maintaining highly optimized kernels, and building performance modeling, profiling, and accuracy debugging tools. Together, these efforts ensure that Neuron delivers best-in-class performance, flexibility, and usability for customers deploying large-scale machine learning models. As a student intern, you will contribute to the efforts that make Neuron best-in-class for ML workloads. You'll gain hands-on experience building business-critical features, analyzing performance, developing compiler or kernel optimizations, and building tools that provide deep insights into model execution. You'll be mentored by experienced engineers while working on technology that directly accelerates customer workloads at scale.
