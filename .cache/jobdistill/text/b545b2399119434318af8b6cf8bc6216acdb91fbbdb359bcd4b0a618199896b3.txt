The role includes exploring LLM interactions with mathematical proofs at an introductory level and developing new course materials that enable students to use AI tools effectively while developing critical thinking skills. This position will contribute to understanding how AI can enhance mathematical education while guarding against "cognitive offloading" (i.e., letting the AI do too much of the thinking and practice, resulting in diminished learning for the user). We are seeking a detail-oriented, conscientious student with experience in mathematical proof writing, some familiarity with LLMs, and knowledge of LaTeX. The key attributes we look for are strong analytical skills, attention to detail, creativity in problem design, and an interest in the intersection of AI and mathematics education. This position reports to faculty members in the Department of Mathematics leading the project. Work Performed: - Explores how LLMs interact with mathematical proofs at the introductory level - Tests LLM capabilities to generate new, valid proof problems based on example problems - Evaluates how LLMs can provide assistance in the proof learning process - Develops and tests LLM-generated example proofs/solutions for mathematical problems - Assesses LLM capabilities in providing feedback on student proofs written in LaTeX - Explores the limitations in mathematical reasoning of various LLMs - Creates new questions for Canvas quizzes, in-class exercises, and homework assignments - Develops documentation summarizing best practices, limitations, and ethical considerations for LLM use in mathematical contexts - Maintains accurate records of findings and progress - Participates in collaborative meetings with faculty supervisors Job Requirements Education/Work Experience - Successful completion of Math 220 (Mathematical Proof) or equivalent introductory proof course - Experience using LLMs as a user - Experience with Canvas as a student; any experience developing materials for teaching in Canvas would be an asset but not expected Skills - Foundational skills in mathematical proof writing and logical reasoning - Familiarity with Large Language Models and their capabilities as a user - Working knowledge of LaTeX for mathematical document preparation - Critical thinking and problem-solving abilities - Attention to detail and thoroughness in assessment - Ability to work both independently and collaboratively - Excellent written and verbal communication skills - Responsible, professional, reliable Equipment - We would ask for those hired to use their own computers (work files will be private but are not sensitive, i.e., this work will not involve handling personal information); a current consumer-grade laptop would be sufficient.
