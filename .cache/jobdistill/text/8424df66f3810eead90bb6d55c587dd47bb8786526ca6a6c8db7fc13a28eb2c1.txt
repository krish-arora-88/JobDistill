That's the goal of PLAICraft. We're building embodied AI agents that can see, listen, and act intelligently in an open-world Minecraft environment. To train these agents, we've created a free, browser-based Minecraft platform where players around the world contribute gameplay data- everything from video and audio to mouse movements and keypresses. This massive dataset helps our researchers develop advanced AI technologies like diffusion models and world modeling, which teach AI to understand how environments work and adapt when things change. Our platform is already live with a growing user base and a substantial volume of collected data. If you're a motivated individual who wants to contribute to cutting-edge AI research while having fun in Minecraft, we'd love to have you on our team.
