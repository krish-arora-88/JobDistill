Join our ML Commerce team and contribute directly to an innovative project that aims to improve the product discovery journey during the e-commerce website experience. Your mission: improve the performance of the existing product recommendation services, leveraging real-time user data, namely Session Based Recommenders (SBR) and enable prioritization of new AI features through validation of scientific and technical feasibility. As an intern, you will work on a project that seeks to impact both the user experience and the revenue impact of e-commerce businesses. One of the main challenges to solving this problem is the cold-start phenomenon attributed to both shoppers and products. With the latest improvements in large language models (LLMs), an opportunity arises for improved understanding of shopper's preferences and intention based on in-session context and interactions and the development of recommendation strategies. What your typical day would look like: Define the hypotheses and research questions of the project with the support of your Coveo supervisor. • • Perform the experiment design, acceptance criteria and prioritization of the experiments linked to the project, in collaboration with your internal supervisor. • Follow the defined applied science practices defined internally in the team. • Produce experiment journals and promote discussion of obtained results and observations. • Iterate on findings and propose next steps on every iteration with the collaboration of your internal supervisor. Here's what will qualify you for the role: You are currently pursuing a professional master's degree with a focus in machine learning. • • You have experience in machine learning or data science, with a focus on modeling. • You are proficient in Python and familiar with modern ML libraries (scikit-learn, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, Sentence Transformers). • You possess strong analytical skills, scientific rigor, and a thirst for learning. Here's what will make up stand out: You have experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, particularly in LLMs and recommendation systems, • particularly usage of embeddings. You don't need to check every single box; passion goes a long way and we appreciate that skills are transferable. Send us your application, we want to hear from you! Join the Coveolife! We encourage all candidates to apply regardless of, for example, age, gender, disability, gaps in CV, national or ethnic background.
