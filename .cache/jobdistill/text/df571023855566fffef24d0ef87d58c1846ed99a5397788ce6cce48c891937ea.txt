Our work plays a key role informing the development of energy and climate change policy across the country. We are looking for a co-op with strong quantitative skills and an interest in climate change and energy policy. The target pay range for this position is $3,800 to $5,800 per month for a full-time (37.5 hours per week on average) position, depending on level of experience. We are seeking to hire a 4-month co-op beginning in January 2025 (we are open to extension to 8 or 12 months for the right candidate). A day in the life… As a co-op student with Navius, you would get to contribute to applied mathematical modeling of climate change policy for provincial governments, utilities, industry, and stakeholder organizations. This could include contributing to Navius' model code, conducting data analytics and visualization, and communicating results to Navius' clients. For some examples of the exciting work we do, here are some recent or ongoing projects at the firm: • Energy-economy model leasing: Navius' gTech-IESD model is leased to four provincial governments who use our tools to forecast provincial greenhouse gas emissions, develop climate change policies, and assess economic costs and benefits. See: Government of British Columbia's CleanBC strategy. • Electricity load forecasting for decarbonization: Navius Research was retained by B.C. Hydro Load Forecasting to identify how achieving the province's targets for greenhouse gas emissions would affect provincial electricity demand. • Renewable fuels markets: we prepare an annual report "Biofuels in Canada", which uses public data to catalog the volume of transportation biofuels consumed in each Canadian province, while estimating the impact of biofuel consumption on greenhouse gas emissions and transportation energy costs from 2010 to 2024. • Economic impact analysis: Navius was retained by the Crown Investments Corporation of Saskatchewan to study and quantify the economic impact of federal climate change policies on Saskatchewan's electricity system. Some of the benefits of working with Navius are: • The opportunity to participate in substantive work at the center of the energy and climate change policy field in Canada. • Open, collaborative, and respectful work environment with lots of spreadsheets and smart, hard-working people. • Senior leadership with industry-leading modeling expertise and experience but no requirement to wear a suit and tie. Great office space in downtown Vancouver, steps from transit, food trucks and the waterfront. • Navius Research offers a flexible work environment to employees, with a target that Vancouver-based employees come to the office 2-3 days per week. Navius staff enjoy a monthly membership to pool and fitness facilities at the YWCA. Your responsibilities As part of the Navius team, you will: • Support the development, maintenance and operation of Navius' gTech computable general equilibrium and linear optimization models. • Prepare code in GAMS, SQL, R, and Python to customize Navius' models to client needs and data. • Review, interpret and troubleshoot quantitative results. • Prepare data analytics and visualization. Contribute to reports, memos and presentation decks for clients, translating complex modeling results into key insights. • Contact us If this sounds like an exciting opportunity and you've got the skills and experience we're looking for, please apply via UBC co-op portal by November 12, 2025.

Navius works extensively with GAMS, SQL, and R, but we understand that skills are transferable from other languages like AMPL, Julia, or Python. Familiarity with basic concepts of energy and greenhouse gas emissions and a good ability to do unit conversions. • Desired skills Navius' consulting work covers a broad scope. We will try to match applicants with project work that fits their studies and area of interest. Ideal applicants would have some knowledge or coursework in one or more of the following areas: • Experience with linear or non-linear optimization models. • Experience with power systems or capacity expansion models. • Understanding of Canada's energy system (coursework, personal research, or focus on a particular area, such as electricity, buildings, or oil and gas, is okay). • An understanding of key policies, programs, and initiatives on climate change and energy advanced by the provincial and federal governments in Canada. • A familiarity with greenhouse gas emissions accounting and Canada's National Inventory Report. • Coursework in micro or macroeconomics. • Knowledge of renewable fuels and lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. • Excellent written and oral communication skills, with an ability to distill and convey complex technical information.
