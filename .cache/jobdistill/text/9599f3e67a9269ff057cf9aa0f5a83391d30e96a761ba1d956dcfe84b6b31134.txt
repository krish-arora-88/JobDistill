The assistant will help curate and preprocess a retrospective dataset of adult spine X-rays, ensuring proper de-identification and metadata organization. They will implement and fine-tune CNN architectures for vertebral segmentation, collaborate on algorithm development to compute alignment parameters (e.g., Cobb angle, sagittal vertical axis, pelvic tilt), and validate outputs against manual measurements by expert raters. The role includes optimizing model performance, conducting statistical assessments of accuracy and inter-rater reliability, and stratifying results by surgical procedure type (e.g., fusion level, osteotomy). • Risks for Vascular Complications in Anterior Spine Surgery: This clinical study investigates risk factors for vascular injury during anterior revisions following prior lumbar surgery. The assistant will extract surgical and imaging data from electronic health records and operative reports, assemble a cohort of adult revision cases, and collate intra-operative fluoroscopic images. Responsibilities include defining candidate predictors (e.g., anatomical metrics, prior instrumentation patterns), performing quantitative measurements on pre- and operative imaging, and applying appropriate statistical models (logistic regression, survival analysis) to identify associations with documented vascular events. The assistant will contribute to data cleaning, variable coding, radiological measurements and pathology classifications. Key Responsibilities: • Assist in machine learning algorithm development and testing for automated spine alignment calculations • Contribute to comparative analysis between automated and manual assessment methods • Participate in validation studies for clinical workflow integration • Acquire, process and analyze and spine radiographic data • Support clinical data collection and analysis for vascular complication predictors Assist with patient outcome data management and statistical analysis • Job Requirements Skills Required: • Familiarity with medical imaging (radiographs, CT) • Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities Experience with clinical data management preferred • Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through UBC Science Co-op Cover Letter Required?
