Design for AI interaction: Shape how people prompt, correct, and understand AI-turning opaque behavior into clear feedback loops. 3. User research & testing: Observe users in real workflows, identify friction, and translate findings into actionable design improvements. 4. Collaborate deeply: Work hand-in-hand with Product Managers and Engineers to align design intent with technical feasibility. 5. Document & communicate: Create simple, visual specs and short write-ups that make design decisions easy to understand. What you'll work with Figma (core) • Design systems & components • Simple motion or microinteraction prototypes • Prompt/agent sandboxes • Docs/slides for design narratives • Optional HTML/CSS/JS or no-code tools for proof-of- concept prototypes. Why you'll love it 1. Real users, real impact: You'll design interfaces that enterprise clients actually use daily. 2. AI design challenges: Learn to make complex systems explainable, trustworthy, and even delightful. 3.
