For more information about our Emerging Talent Program, visit https://www.ea.com/careers/interns-and-university-graduates We are EA And we make games - how cool is that? In fact, we entertain millions of people across the globe with the most amazing and immersive interactive software in the industry. But making games is hard work. That's why we employ the most creative, passionate people in the industry. The Challenge Ahead The Game Developer Experience (GDX) organization exists to improve the day-to-day experience of our game developers by creating tools and platforms that increase productivity, reduce friction, and streamline the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). As part of this mission, our team focuses on applying modern technologies - including Generative AI - to solve real problems faced by developers building EA's games. This internship is a technical role that offers hands-on experience designing and building developer-facing tools that enable efficiency at scale. You will help explore, prototype, and implement AI-enabled solutions that integrate deeply into existing development workflows and tools such as Perforce, GitLab, JIRA, and Slack. One example of the team's work includes building an AI-assisted code review capability for Perforce, addressing a gap where no off-the-shelf solution currently exists. You will work closely with game teams and central technology groups to understand developer pain points and translate them into practical, scalable solutions. These tools are built with a cloud-first mindset and leverage public cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, along with modern automation and integration patterns. Throughout the internship, you will gain exposure to the full lifecycle of developer tooling - from problem discovery and technical design to implementation and iteration - while collaborating with experienced engineers in an agile environment. Your work will directly contribute to improving how EA's game developers build, review, test, and ship games. Key Responsibilities Solution ownership: • Contribute to the design and development of internal developer-facing tools that improve productivity and reduce friction across the SDLC • Work on features that integrate into existing developer workflows and tools such as Perforce, GitLab, JIRA, and Slack • Help prototype and implement AI-enabled capabilities (e.g., code review assistance, workflow automation, developer insights) • Contribute on all facets of a project, including gathering requirements from key technical leaders, creating a vision and strategy, presenting to leadership, developing the product roadmap, ensuring projects are on track and completed on time, managing communication with all stakeholders, and collaborating with the development team • Participate in all aspects of a solution end-to-end, including design, implementation, support, vendor relations and customer interaction • Manage relationships with vendors if applicable, including sourcing, evaluation, and escalation Software Development and Engineering: • Write clean, maintainable, and testable code as part of a modern engineering team • Participate in code reviews, both giving and receiving feedback, with an emphasis on learning best practices • Assist in designing modular services and APIs that can scale to support many development teams • Participates in support and administrative actions related to the installation and maintenance of production systems, while also engineering solutions that require minimal support • Leverages the cloud where appropriate, utilizing automation, cloud computing and configuration as code Collaboration and Learning: • Collaborate with engineers, product partners, and game teams to understand real developer pain points • Contribute ideas and feedback that help shape the evolution of internal tools Learn and apply agile development practices in a fast-paced, iterative environment • Job Requirements Job qualifications and requirements • Solid programming fundamentals in at least one modern language (e.g., C#, Java, Python, or JavaScript) • Understanding of basic software engineering concepts such as version control, testing, and code quality • Familiarity with modern development workflows using tools like Git or Perforce • Interest in building tools that improve the developer experience • Experience with SQL/NoSQL databases • Experience with cloud platforms (e.g. Azure, or AWS) and containerization technologies Preferred requirements • Experience using AI-powered tools for coding, learning, or automation (e.g., code assistants, chat-based tools) • Exposure to or curiosity about Generative AI, large language models, or AI-assisted development tools • Exposure to or familiarity with modern Generative AI concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), embeddings, vector databases, or prompt engineering You must be available for a full-time paid internship in the summer of 2026.
