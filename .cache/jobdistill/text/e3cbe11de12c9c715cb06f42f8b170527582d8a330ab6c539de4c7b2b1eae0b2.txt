Here are some potential projects: 1) Managing actions for Service Nodes in DMF This project involves developing the frontend for the Service Node, a high-performance server appliance designed to transform and pre-analyze line-rate traffic. The primary goal is to create a responsive, intuitive, high-performing web interface allowing users to interact with and visualize complex network data in real-time. The project will leverage React and other technologies to build the front end, focusing on performance optimization and seamless integration with backend systems. The frontend will communicate with RESTful APIs to display real-time data, requiring careful attention to detail in data handling and user experience design. Collaboration across teams, including backend developers, product managers, and UX/UI designers, will be essential to deliver a product that meets high usability and performance standards. 2) Monitoring Network Topology Visualization This project focuses on developing a sophisticated frontend for visualizing data center monitoring and network topology. The goal is to create an intuitive, interactive interface that provides real-time insights into the health and performance of a data center's network infrastructure. Leveraging React and modern web technologies, the project will involve designing a dynamic visualization tool that maps out network topology, including devices, connections, and traffic flow. The interface will offer real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing users to track network performance and identify potential issues. Integration with backend systems will be crucial for retrieving and displaying data from various network monitoring tools and APIs.
