Backed by VC funding and we've been recognized with the 2025 Frost & Sullivan Technology Innovation Leadership Award, the AAM Supplier Excellence Innovation Award, and the 2024 BC Tech "Company of the Year - Growth", we are on a mission to redefine the future of AI-driven robotic vision systems. Apera AI helps manufacturers make their factories more flexible and productive. Robots enhanced with Apera's software have 4D Vision - the ability to see and handle objects with human-like capability. Challenging applications such as bin picking, sorting, packaging, and assembly are now open to fast, precise, and reliable automation. Apera is led by an experienced team from high-growth companies focused on robotics, artificial intelligence, and advanced manufacturing. Role Overview: Apera AI is seeking a Full Stack Software Developer (Co-op) to join the team behind Apera Forge, our web-based simulation and development platform for vision-guided robotics. As a co-op developer, you'll contribute across the software stack-helping to deliver new functionality, improve developer tooling, and support the cloud infrastructure that powers Forge. This role is based in person at our Vancouver office and is an 8-month co-op term. You'll work with experienced engineers across product, cloud, and simulation domains. This is a hands-on role where your work will be reviewed, tested, and integrated into a real production system. Employee Value Proposition (EVP): • Purpose: Your work will directly support robotics engineers who rely on Forge to simulate and test robotic vision workflows. You'll help accelerate how robotic solutions are developed and deployed. • Growth: You'll gain experience with modern development practices including full-stack web development, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and developer tooling-all within a fast-paced robotics startup. • Motivators: You'll be part of a team that values clarity, iteration, and shipping working software. You'll learn how to write production-grade code, contribute to team rituals like sprint planning and code reviews, and see your work make a tangible difference. Major Objectives: • Ship a Full-Stack Feature by Mid-Term: Within the first 8-10 weeks, collaborate on a small but meaningful feature-from ticket breakdown and UI mock-ups to API integration and deployment. Success is measured by quality, user experience, and test coverage. [Tech: React, Python, Flask, GitHub] • Improve Developer Workflow or Test Coverage: Identify a pain point in the development or testing workflow and propose a solution (e.g., test automation, build script improvement, better error logging). Aim to implement and document the improvement by the end of the term. [Tech: GitHub Actions, Pytest, Docker] • Contribute to Cloud Deployment Reliability: Support the maintenance of cloud infrastructure by helping monitor logs, address deployment issues, or improve scripts related to container builds or service health. [Tech: AWS, Docker, CloudWatch] Critical Subtasks: • Participate in sprint planning, stand-ups, and code reviews. • Break down feature requests into tasks with guidance from mentors. • Implement and test UI components in React, integrating with backend APIs. • Write and run unit/integration tests for new features. • Help reproduce and debug user-facing issues in test environments. Document what you build for future co-ops and developers. • Culture and Situation Fit: Apera Forge is built by a tight-knit, collaborative team that values clarity, simplicity, and learning by doing. You'll fit well if: • You're eager to contribute and ready to learn by shipping real code. • You enjoy solving technical problems and working across the stack. You're comfortable asking questions and sharing your progress. • Job Requirements Required Qualifications: • Experience with either Python or React through coursework or projects. • Familiarity with Git and basic web development practices. A desire to work with cloud-hosted applications and modern DevOps tooling. • Bonus Experience (Not Required): • Experience with AWS or Docker. • Exposure to robotics, 3D graphics, or simulation environments. Contributions to open-source projects or previous co-op terms. • Why You'll Love It Here: • Purpose with impact: Help enable smarter, safer automation in real industries • Learning by doing: Apply academic knowledge to real production systems • Supportive culture: Collaborative, curious, and people-first Great location: Gastown office with transit access and a vibrant tech community • Citizenship Requirement N/A Position Start Date Position End Date May 04, 2026 12:00 AM December 31, 2026 12:00 AM APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Cover Letter Required?
