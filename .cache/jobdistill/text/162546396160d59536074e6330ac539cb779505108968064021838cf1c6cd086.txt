To maintain fresh perspectives and new energy from the emerging workforce, we're hiring our next cohort of Co-op Software Developers to join our agile development teams, focusing on our SaaS-based Program Experience solutions. Opportunity & Impact In this Software Developer Co-op role, you get to work in a setup that allows you to hit the ground running and spend time focusing on what matters: building software with other skilled developers and making lifelong career connections while doing real work. You'll work alongside senior and intermediate-level developers with extensive experience, frequently pairing (as needed) for guidance and review as you learn to write well-designed code that passes code reviews and other quality checks. You get a chance to actively participate in daily standups, sprint cycle meetings, and retrospectives and experience collaborative practices that are structured and continuously honed for improvement and efficiency. Working as a Software Developer Co-op at Acuity means you'll contribute meaningfully to the success of product/feature initiatives and other development tasks. You have a chance to read and become familiar with pre-existing code and techniques so you can debug and improve it safely. You get to work on features at all levels of the tech stack, from front-end to back-end, and participate in solutions design. You'll practice communicating with other team members and stakeholders on initiatives you're working on, and providing progress updates and demos. You'll meet with your manager weekly in 1-1s, where you'll have the chance to ask questions, give or gather feedback, and receive any other help you need. Our team is 100% invested in your training and success during your time with us because we depend on your work. You'll be trained the same as permanent Software Developers, and by the time your 8-month term is over, you will be a fully operational full- stack developer on your team, ready to tackle any challenge. We understand that long-term success is more than just about work happening today. Supporting you in building a happy, sustainable life beyond work aligns with our core values. Building a successful academic career sometimes means enrolling in coursework during your Co-op term. We are happy to support you with flexibility in ensuring you can achieve both a full-time Co-op position and course enrollment if you choose. This is a remote-first, paid full-time co-op position and reports to the Development Manager of the team you're part of. To thrive in the role, you: Have some prior professional experience (work or volunteer work) (non-technical is fine) where someone counted on you in a professional setting Can communicate well about code and technical issues Always look for ways to improve yourself and everything around you, and be willing to pitch in on whatever needs to be done.

To thrive at Acuity, you are: Caring toward people. You show up, take time to listen and understand, encourage and support, and don't shy away from providing feedback and mentoring, and teaching others to help them grow. Curious by nature and open to possibilities. You like to explore, ask questions, experiment, and learn. Driven to problem-solve and biased towards action.
