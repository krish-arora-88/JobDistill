Based in California with a Canadian office in Vancouver, it is run by Silicon Valley veterans and industry titans Andy Bechtolsheim, Ken Duda, and Jayshree Ullal. Arista is developing a new class of integrated network solutions to address the scalability, performance, and reliability requirements of large-scale high performance computing and cloud datacenters. Arista plays a key role in the datacenters of companies ranging from Facebook to Microsoft, from AOL to Comcast, from ESPN to Netflix, from Citigroup to Morgan Stanley. What's Cool at Arista? *Cloud* *Software defined networks* *Network virtualization* Empowered engineers. Our engineers are empowered with full responsibility for their projects. Our management structure is flat and lightweight -- you are in charge of delivering your work from design to code to test to customer shipment. Insane amount of automation! We have run close to 20 million tests in our mini-data center that operates 24/7. We put a premium on building and using tools that make everyone super-productive. This translates into quicker turnaround times on new features and products for increased revenue with smaller teams. We value openness. No part of the company is off-limits, meaning that our engineers have the chance to work on a variety of different areas. All our interns have the same responsibility as our full timers and get to work side-by-side on important, customer- impacting projects. Software engineers at Arista deliver product features. The core responsibility is writing the code that drives our products. A software engineer is more than just a coding machine; they drive the whole development process including - deciding the features to build - driving the design - writing and testing the code - documenting the feature - supporting customers in the field Along the way, you might - extend and improve the test infrastructure - hack on our engineering tools Example Projects We don't have time for busy work: every project that we do has customers clamoring for it. Along with quick release cycles and an engineer-oriented culture means we always have a slew of interesting projects to tackle. What project you'll work on at Arista will vary a lot depending on our customer demands and your interests. Here are some sample potential projects: 1) Implement a stream processing blade Our Aeris platform streams data from all switches in the customer network for real-time monitoring and historical analysis. Blades are stream processors written in Go that subscribe to some subset of data, transform it, and write the new data back into the system. We have blades that take counter streams and produce rate data, blades that calculate aggregates of various metrics (e.g. long term average, min, max), blades that trigger events based on real-time data, and we're adding more every day. 2) Improve stream processing infrastructure Our stream processors are built over common infrastructure that handles functions such as event ordering, startup and restarts, subscriptions etc. We are constantly improving that infrastructure to reduce memory usage, improve performance, and provide better accuracy. 3) Adding scale testing metrics Our systems are designed to run in the cloud at any scale. One of the challenges is to validate that systems scale as intended. We work on tools to simulate the load our system will see in production and instrumenting the systems for performance analysis. 4) Aggregating metrics for network topology views We are building network visualization tools that allow customers to manage their networks more efficiently. As part of this effort we preprocess low level metrics to form higher level metrics that are more useful for a customer. An example is summing up transfer (or error) rates over all connections between two switches or two groups of switches. This can give the customer a quick overview where otherwise they'd need to potentially look at hundreds of metrics.
