FPGA Software Tool Developer Co-op Ref #26839 Waterdown, Ontario About L3HARRIS WESCAM As a subsidiary of L3Harris Technologies and within the Integrated Mission Systems Segment, the WESCAM division develops the most advanced optical sensor and targeting systems for global defense and military sectors, National Security, Search & Rescue and Airborne law enforcement agencies. From long-range covert surveillance missions to search and rescue operations, our MX- series systems, and the mission systems solutions they are a part of, produce stabilized high-magnification electro-optical and infrared images from airborne, marine and ground based platforms, enabling our customers to see first and act first. About the Role We are looking for a co-op student to support the Firmware team at WESCAM by developing and maintaining internal software tools (web applications) that are used to make the team more efficient. Are you looking for a role that will help you make a difference? This is it! Your contribution will have an immediate and significant impact on our Firmware team's efficiency. Who is the firmware team? I'm glad you asked! We are a team full of bright and exceptionally friendly people who work together to create a wide variety of solutions to complex and challenging problems. In order to ensure exceptional results, our team creates reusable IP by following a rigorous process that begins with requirements, is supported by documentation and ends with verification. Our work is supported by internally developed software tools that enable us to consistently implement robust and reliable designs in an efficient manner. These tools improve our results and allow us to focus our energy on future solutions, not fixing past mistakes. Our team is split into two equally valuable groups. The Design team owns the design and is responsible for creating innovative solutions for our customers. The Verification team is committed to confirming that the modules we produce behave exactly as specified. Neither group could stand on its own, but together are successful. Our team of highly skilled individuals have both a depth and breadth in their roles. We all perform some level of verification; we all participate in requirements definition & design engineering and we all take an active role in developing new design concepts and product launches. An FPGA design cannot live in isolation and we collaborate regularly with other departments to ensure the best solution at the system level. This collaboration has earned us a reputation for producing high quality designs that are easy to integrate and actively supported. We track and report design progress so that our Leadership team can be well informed as they allocate resources. We also understand the complex world of FPGA designs as a marathon, not a sprint. We recognize that being excellent in life goes well beyond engineering and includes actively participating in our communities and spending time with friends and family. With this in mind, we set aggressive but achievable goals that allow us to feel challenged while maintaining a work life balance.
