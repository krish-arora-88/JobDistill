Our work spans robotic hardware, digital illustration, generative design tools, and the software infrastructure that connects them. We're looking for a **Software Developer** to join in an **Intern** or **Full-Time** role who is excited to learn by building real things. You'll work on production-adjacent systems, not toy projects, and contribute directly to the tools, models, and infrastructure that power our work. This role is intentionally hands-on. You'll be trusted with meaningful problems, supported by talented engineers, and expected to learn quickly, iterate often, and take ownership of your work. --- ## What Success Looks Like - You Get Shit Done - and have a good time doing it --- ## Why You Might Love Working Here - You'll work on real systems, not isolated side projects. - You'll get fast feedback and mentorship from experienced engineers. - You'll be part of a small team working on ambitious problems. - We want you to succeed, you'll be given a growth plan and resources to help you level up as an engineer --- ## Why You Might Not Love It Here - We move quickly, and priorities can change. - We operate under the assumption that if you say you'll complete something, you're expected to move mountains to get it done - You'll be expected to manage your time and ask for help when you need it. - This is a learning-by-doing environment, it can feel uncomfortable at times. Job Requirements ## What You'll Do - Work closely with engineers to design, build, and ship software that supports our generative and physical AI systems. - Build features, tools, or experiments that have real users or downstream impact. - Iterate quickly: ship early versions, test assumptions, gather feedback, and improve. - Contribute to projects across the stack depending on your interests and skills, such as: - Prototyping generative AI workflows or training pipelines - Building internal tools or creative interfaces for digital art design - Developing web-based or desktop applications - Supporting vision, simulation, or robotics-related software - Take ownership of small but meaningful projects from start to finish. - Get your hands dirty doing real work that has real impacts for the company --- ## Who You Are You are someone who learns best by doing. - You like to move fast. You'd rather build a rough version early, test it, and iterate than wait for perfect clarity. - You have opinions about how things should work, and you're open to being wrong. You ask "why," challenge ideas respectfully, and change your mind when you learn something new. - You care deeply about whether something actually works for the user. Bugs, broken flows, and confusing behavior bother you. - You finish what you start. "Done" means tested, verified, and followed up on, not just pushed to a branch. - You are generous with your time and energy. You help teammates, ask good questions, and share what you learn. - You are comfortable with ambiguity. When requirements aren't fully defined, you make reasonable assumptions and keep moving. - You enjoy building things with your hands as well as with code, whether that's prototyping, tinkering, or experimenting with hardware or simulations. - You communicate clearly, are open to feedback, and care about doing good work. - You like supporting people. The best part of your day should be solving someone's problem You don't need to be an expert, but you should have some familiarity with or strong interest in: - Python or JavaScript/TypeScript - Web or application development (e.g. React, Next.js, or similar) - Machine learning concepts or tooling (e.g. Huggingface, Replicate, LORAs) Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Cover Letter Required?
