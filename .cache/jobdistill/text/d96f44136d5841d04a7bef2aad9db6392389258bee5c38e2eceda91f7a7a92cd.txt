We started in 2011 with one simple idea. Make it easier for practitioners to access the products they trust so they can deliver better care. That simple idea grew into a platform that powers every part of care. Today, more than 125,000 practitioners use Fullscript for clinical insights, lab interpretations, patient analytics, education, and access to high-quality supplements. Over 10 million patients rely on Fullscript to stay connected to their care plans and follow through on treatment. We build tools that make care smarter and more human. Tools that save time, simplify decisions, and help practitioners stay closely connected to the people they care for.
