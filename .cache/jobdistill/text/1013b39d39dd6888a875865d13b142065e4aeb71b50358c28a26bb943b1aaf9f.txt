The NRC/ Aquatic and Crop Resource Development Research Centre The National Research Council (NRC) is the Government of Canada's largest research organization supporting industrial innovation, the advancement of knowledge and technology development. It represents a powerful partnering option for anyone looking to push the boundaries of science and industry. The NRC's Aquatic and Crop Resource Development Research Centre (ACRD) performs advanced scientific research and provides research services and technology development for the sustainable transformation of Canadian bio-based resources into higher-value products. Our crop-based research focuses on ensuring a diverse and sustainable supply of resources for the Canadian agriculture and food ecosystem. Towards crop resource development, we are developing advanced tools and technologies to: • Increase the productivity, resilience and sustainability of traditional and economically important crops for Canada. • Optimize the production of plant-based protein ingredients. Advance data-driven and AI-ML solutions for Canada's agriculture and food strategies. • Your Challenge As a student joining NRC ACRD, you will undertake career-related projects in an engaging and intellectually stimulating environment, working alongside leading scientists. You will be a key member of a team developing an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) software solution, using open-source frameworks, to store, organize, and search lab records. The ELN will provide secure, role-based access, allowing researchers to record experimental histories, metadata, and procedures. The ELN solution will involve the student designing and implementing a robust database, web service, and software application, ensuring the system is scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain. The successful student will make important contributions to increasing research efficiency and traceability at NRC ACRD through ELN implementation and configuration, while gaining critical experience in software development, data management, and research support within a federal organization. By digitizing lab records, the ELN will improve findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of data.
