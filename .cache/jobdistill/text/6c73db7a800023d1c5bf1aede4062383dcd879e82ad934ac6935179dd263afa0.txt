The co-op student will be working on developing embedded software/firmware for the digitizer for this upgrade. The ST Digitizer is a commercial hardware platform with a Xilinx Radio Frequency System on Chip (RFSoC) FPGA. The FPGA contains an ARM processor. The student will be working on the development, testing and integration of embedded software/firmware using design tools such as VHDL/Verilog, Vivado, Peta Linux, Python and PYNQ. The tasks include the configuration of a Linux-based Operating System (OS) for embedded ARM processor; embedded software development for the ARM processor to monitor and control custom IP blocks; and documentation of embedded software design and test results. Responsibilities: 1. Develop and test VHDL/Verilog firmware to integrate custom IP blocks in Xilinx RFSoC FPGA. 2. Build custom Linux image for RFSoC FPGA ARM processor. 3. Develop and test embedded software for RFSoC FPGA ARM processor and its peripherals (1GbE, uSD, SPI, I2C, UART, USB, DDR4, and GPIOs). 4. Develop and test embedded software to monitor and control custom IP blocks. 5. Document the design and test results for RFSoC FPGA Digitizer development. Job Requirements 1. Some working experience with digital circuit, FPGA and HDL (Hardware Description Language). 2. Some working experience with C/C++. 3. Some working experience with Linux. 4. Some working experience with Python. 5. Some familiarity with signal processing (ADC/DAC, FFT, FIR) would be a plus, but not required. Other requirements: The successful applicant will be required to obtain a reliability security clearance to access the DRAO facility. Associated costs will be covered by the employer. This position is funded by a grant from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) to UBCO. Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through UBC Science Co-op Address Cover Letter to Dr. Alex Hill Special Application Instructions Requested documents: Please provide a brief cover letter explaining your interest and qualifications for this position including names and contact information for two references, a resume or curriculum vitae, and an unofficial transcript. Reports to: The co-op student will report to Prof Alex Hill (UBCO Astronomy) and work closely with Dr Thushara Gunaratne and Heng Zhang (DRAO).
