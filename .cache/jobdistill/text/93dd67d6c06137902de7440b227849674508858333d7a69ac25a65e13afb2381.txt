On the non-AI side, our standard tech stack: React.js/React Native/Redux (sophisticated custom web application dev), Node.js back end stack, AWS infrastructure (complex multi-environment ecosystems with many moving parts), and all of the other things you may expect in a MERN-stack tech company. This evolves over time, of course. Some - but not all - of our projects have custom AI/ML development requirements. Typically, TensorFlow-based NLP development. Python experience will be important. AI/ML projects may involve aspects such as: • Verifying data quality, and/or ensuring it via data cleaning • Supervising the data acquisition process if more data is needed • Understanding business objectives and developing models that help to achieve them, along with metrics to track their progress • Defining the preprocessing or feature engineering to be done on a given dataset • Analyzing the ML algorithms that could be used to solve a given problem and ranking them by their success probability Analyzing the errors of the model and designing strategies to overcome them • There is a preference for individuals that can double as a software developer in the React/Node/TypeScript stack. The role may shift between AI/ML support efforts, and web application development efforts (non-AI related). This position shall be in-office and based out of our spaces in the heart of beautiful Downtown Vancouver. You will also be the type of person that enjoys the pace and entrepreneurial spirit of a small-and-growing company.
