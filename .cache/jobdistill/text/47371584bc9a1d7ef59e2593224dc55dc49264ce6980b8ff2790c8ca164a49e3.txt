What's Cool at Arista? *Cloud* *Software defined networks* *Network virtualization* Empowered engineers. Our engineers are empowered with full responsibility for their projects. Our management structure is flat and lightweight -- you are in charge of delivering your work from design to code to test to customer shipment. Insane amount of automation! We have run close to 20 million tests in our mini-data center that operates 24/7. We put a premium on building and using tools that make everyone super-productive. This translates into quicker turn around times on new features and products for increased revenue with smaller teams. We value openness. No part of the company is off-limits, meaning that our engineers have the chance to work on a variety of different areas. All our interns have the same responsibility as our full timers and get to work side-by-side on important, customer- impacting projects. Job Requirements The Ideal Candidate - loves to program and finds satisfaction in creating a well-written piece of code - doesn't shy away from hard problems and enjoys the challenge of making reliable software - wants to work side-by-side with the brightest minds in software, systems, and hardware - learns how things work, just for fun or out of curiosity - cares about the business too You have (or want to have) experience with some set of - Java/Kotlin - Go - Python - Distributed systems - Network protocols such as TCP/IP, Ethernet - Linux The Job Software engineers at Arista deliver product features. The core responsibility is writing the code that drives our products. A software engineer is more than just a coding machine; they drive the whole development process including - deciding the features to build - driving the design - writing the code (duh!) and testing - documenting the feature - supporting customers in the field Along the way, you might - extend and improve the test infrastructure - hack on our engineering tools, including p4, django, python, rpm, ... - work with sales and business development Interview Information The interview will include a 45 minute technical component which will involve coding in one of Java, Kotlin, Go, Python or C++. We expect you to run and debug your code -- impress us with your problem solving skills along with your coding abilities. *** Please note that we will not be monitoring the Co-op Portals for applications *** Example Projects We don't have time for busy work: every project that we do has customers clamoring for it. Along with quick release cycles and an engineer-oriented culture means we always have a slew of interesting projects to tackle. What project you'll work on at Arista will vary a lot depending on our customer demands and your interests. Here are some sample potential projects: 1) Application orchestration: Providing iso based firstboot parameters to CVP Applied Technologies: Kotlin, python, REST API, Virtualization The CloudVision Appliance (CVA) is a server hardware running various on-premise Arista solutions, including CloudVision Portal (CVP). CVP requires specific parameters (e.g., IP address, username, password) to operate. These are added to an ISO file and mounted as a CD-ROM to the VM during its deployment. This project aims to streamline the ISO file generation process from the CVA by developing the necessary REST API and backend infrastructure. 2) Protocols: Supporting sampling option for the gNMI streaming Applied Technologies: Java, python, gRPC, gNMI, YANG, telemetry gNMI, an open-source protocol, enables collectors to retrieve telemetry data from network devices. This project aims to implement the gNMI server's capability to send telemetry states to the collector at a predefined frequency, specified by the collector during the subscription process. This enhancement will allow for more efficient and customized data collection from network devices. By enabling the collector to define the frequency, the system becomes more flexible and adaptable to various needs. 3) Cloud Vision Managed Recorder Node: Implement RPC request & response fragmentation Applied Technologies: Go, gRPC, YANG The Atlas platform facilitates the management of the DMF recorder nodes from the CloudVision Portal (CVP. To address diverse use cases, CVP executes actions on these nodes through an RPC framework provided by Atlas. However, the data exchanged through this framework can occasionally surpass the maximum message size supported by system components. This project aims to enable the handling of large request and response bodies by fragmenting the original request at the transport layer based on a defined threshold, and then reassembling them while keeping the fragmentation process transparent to both the server and the client. 4) Supporting heterogeneous clustering for rolling upgrades Applied Technologies: Java, Distributed Systems The Atlas platform software can form a cluster when deployed on multiple nodes. To minimize application downtime during rolling upgrades, this project aims to develop a feature on our clustering solution that allows the cluster to function with different nodes running different software versions and with varying application requirements.
