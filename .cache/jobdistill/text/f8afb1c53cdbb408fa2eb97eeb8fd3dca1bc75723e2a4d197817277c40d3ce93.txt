With support from your team, access to learning and development resources, and opportunities for fun along the way, our program will give you the foundation to start your career journey. RippleX assists developers building on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a fast and reliable public blockchain. As a Software Engineer Intern on the Quality Enforcers team for the XRPL ecosystem, you will develop tools and services that keep this large distributed system detailed, credible, and understandable. You will apply software engineering and distributed systems concepts. You'll use AI-assisted methods to improve validation, analysis, and summarization of rippled's behavior under real-world conditions. WHAT YOU'LL DO • Build and implement backend tools and components of a multi?agent system that exercise rippled, orchestrate tests from high?level, natural?language requests, and verify behavior across different scenarios. • Build intelligent data workflows and pipelines over metrics, logs, traces, ledger data, and mainnet telemetry to compare runs to baselines and surface clear, actionable signals (anomalies, trends, hotspots). • Use AI-assisted techniques if they provide customer value. This includes anomaly detection on time-series metrics and logs. It also involves natural-language summaries that make sophisticated run results clear for developers. • Collaborate with engineers on building, code reviews, and documentation, and help refine the heuristics for what "good" looks like for XRPL reliability and performance.
