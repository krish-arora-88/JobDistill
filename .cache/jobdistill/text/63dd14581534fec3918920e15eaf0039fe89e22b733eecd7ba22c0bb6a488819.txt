Backed by VC funding and we've been recognized with the 2025 Frost & Sullivan Technology Innovation Leadership Award, the AAM Supplier Excellence Innovation Award, and the 2024 BC Tech "Company of the Year - Growth", we are on a mission to redefine the future of AI-driven robotic vision systems. Apera AI helps manufacturers make their factories more flexible and productive. Robots enhanced with Apera's software have 4D Vision - the ability to see and handle objects with human-like capability. Challenging applications such as bin picking, sorting, packaging, and assembly are now open to fast, precise, and reliable automation. Apera is led by an experienced team from high-growth companies focused on robotics, artificial intelligence, and advanced manufacturing. Role Overview: Apera AI is seeking a Software Developer (Co-op) with strong C++ skills and an interest in robotics to join our Apera Vue engineering team for the 8 months term period. You'll contribute to the development of real-time machine vision applications that power robotic systems across manufacturing and automation environments. This role is based in-person at our Vancouver office. In this role, you'll build features in C++, support image processing and robotics integration, and contribute to testing efforts in both simulated and physical lab environments. Your work will improve the performance, reliability, and scalability of a system used on real factory floors. Employee Value Proposition (EVP): • Purpose: You'll contribute to the core of our 4D Vision Technology, helping robots perceive and act in complex, real-world environments. Your code will directly impact robotic accuracy, speed, and adaptability. • Growth: You'll deepen your understanding of robotics, computer vision, and modern C++ development. You'll gain experience working in a professional R&D environment with exposure to production code, lab hardware, and team-based workflows. • Motivators: You'll collaborate with engineers solving high-impact technical challenges. You'll take on meaningful tasks that go beyond academic exercises, seeing your code influence how robots make decisions in real time. Major Objectives: • Develop and Ship Core C++ Features for Apera Vue: Within the first 8-10 weeks, contribute a discrete feature or performance improvement to the Apera Vue application. [Tech: C++, Qt, OpenCV] • Support Robotic Integration and Image Processing: Assist in testing and debugging real-world vision system behavior with robotic systems in the lab. Identify edge cases and performance issues. Suggest and test code-level improvements. [Tech: Linear algebra, multithreading, image pipelines] • Improve Code Quality through Testing and Review: Participate in unit testing, test coverage expansion, and refactoring. Contribute to automated testing infrastructure to ensure robustness as the product scales. [Tools: CMake, Git, GTest, internal CI tools] Critical Subtasks: • Participate in daily standups, planning, and code review sessions with experienced engineers. • Implement C++ modules that interact with vision data, robot pose data, or internal image pipelines. • Run and validate your code in a live robotic lab environment. • Write tests and help investigate edge cases or bugs in production builds. • Contribute to documentation and developer notes for the next co-op or new team members. Learn from performance profiling tools to understand how to optimize for speed and memory. • Culture and Situation Fit: At Apera AI, we blend scientific exploration with product execution. Our teams move quickly and iterate often, balancing R&D depth with industry-level engineering. You'll succeed here if: • You enjoy learning by building and testing in the real world. • You're curious about how software meets robotics, perception, and physical action. You value clean, well-documented code and thoughtful collaboration. • Job Requirements Required Qualifications: • Strong knowledge of C++, including object-oriented design and memory management. • Solid foundation in linear algebra, vectors, and 3D transforms. • Experience with version control (e.g., Git). Experience with software projects through coursework, personal work, or prior co-op/internships. • Bonus Experience (Not Required): • Experience in Linux development environments. • Exposure to computer vision or robotics libraries (OpenCV, ROS, PCL). • Knowledge of multithreading or networking in C++. Familiarity with Python for scripting and automation • Citizenship Requirement N/A Position Start Date Position End Date May 04, 2026 12:00 AM December 31, 2026 12:00 AM APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Cover Letter Required?
