Project Description The student with enthusiasm for observational astrophysics will help the observational astronomy team under Wesley Fraser in their search for binary Kuiper Belt Objects in JWST-NIRCam data. The data were acquired in Cycle 1 as part of the Pencil Beam project, from which PhD student Marielle Eduardo has performed the deepest search for moving icy bodies ever performed. In this position, the co-op student will work with Wes and Marielle in modifying the Pencil Beam pipeline software to inject artificial binary sources. These newly implanted data will be passed through the search pipeline to assess how well binary sources can be detected. These results will provide a search for binary Kuiper Belt Objects around bodies as small as 10km in diameter, significantly fainter than any past searches. During this effort, the student will interact with the core of the JWST pipeline, and the machine learning tools that Fraser's team has developed for searches such as this. Length of term This is a «16 week» term. Anticipated dates: starting 5 January 2026, ending 24 April 2026. Your Responsibilities 1. 2. 3. 4. Modification of python-based implantation code that makes use of the JWST pipeline. Generation of a sample of artificial binary Kuiper Belt Object systems. Creation of the implanted code. Application of the search pipeline to the new binary implanted data.
