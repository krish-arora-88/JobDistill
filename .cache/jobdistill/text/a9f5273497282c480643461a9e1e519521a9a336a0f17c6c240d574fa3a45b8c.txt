About your Video Lab Internship State-of-the-art video codecs use a very diverse range of coding tools on different parts of the video codec, such as filtering, intra or inter coding, transforms, entropy coding, as well as for different scenarios, such as natural video content, screen content, gaming content, etc. Also, the use of some tools created for screen content videos has proven to be effective on natural content videos. This internship is carried out in the R&I video coding team in Montreal. The student will get familiar with the state-of-the-art video codecs, will understand how screen content tools are used for video coding improvement. The student will analyze various of these tools that exist and work towards applying improved methods to the current and future video coding standards. The work will involve coding in C++ and a good background in digital signal processing is a must. Roles & Responsibilities: • Familiarize yourself with existing video coding standards such as HEVC and VVC. • Work with reference model software (e.g., VTM, ECM) to understand current implementations. • Review academic and industry literature on screen content coding tools. • Enhance tool usage to improve video coding performance. Implement and test improved algorithms within the test model software. • Expected Outcomes: • Develop a clear understanding and documentation of screen content tools used in video codecs. • Implement enhancements to existing tools in C++ within the test model software. • Evaluate the performance of the improved tools and compare results with state-of-the-art methods. • Produce a comprehensive report detailing the work completed during the internship. • Deliver a final presentation to the R&I team summarizing findings and contributions. This internship is available in 2026, please indicate your availability for a 4+ month internship in the questions associated with your application or a cover letter. Flexibility with start date. Job Requirements Qualifications: • Strong foundation in digital signal processing. • Proficient in C++ programming. • Knowledge of video coding is preferred but not required. Experience with Python and shell scripting is a plus. • Keywords: MPEG, HEVC, VVC, Video Coding, Digital Signal Processing, C++ Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Cover Letter Required?
