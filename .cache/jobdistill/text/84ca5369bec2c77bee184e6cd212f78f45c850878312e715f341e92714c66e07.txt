Massive amounts of energy storage are required if renewable energy is to take its rightful place on the electric grid. Invinity provides an alternative to the most common type of battery, lithium-ion because the battery technology that works so well in our pockets doesn't work as well at the grid scale; it wears out, limits use, and even catches fire. Manufactured as a standardized product in a factory, Invinity's vanadium flow batteries don't degrade, won't catch fire, and can be operated continuously from full charge to full discharge for 25 years. Invinity has 75,000 kilowatt-hours of its modular battery systems in 82 projects across 15 countries - more than any other company in the space. We've deployed the largest flow battery systems in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the UK, and are supported by the UK Infrastructure Bank, the U.S. Department of Energy, and some of the world's leading institutional investors. As a software co-op, you will help our team develop systems and tools that we use to automate the operation and maintenance of our battery systems. A large utility-scale battery like ours contains many controllers networked into a unified control system, and managing that in a variety of situations is no easy task! You will help us with Python-based tools (and do some C development if you're enthusiastic) that allow developers, maintenance personnel and advanced users to perform the wide range of tasks needed to test, commission and operate the battery system. Although this is primarily a software developer position, knowledge and familiarity with electrical concepts is important. Our batteries power the world, so they're not to be taken lightly! In addition, if you're into networking, control systems or linux internals, we have some fun additional tasks for you. We expect everyone on our team to contribute to our products and process, and we want our co-ops to gain valuable experience for their careers. If you're looking for interesting and challenging work, this is the place to be. The work you do and the tasks you're assigned depend entirely on your efforts, so the sky is the limit when you're part of our team. Job Requirements • Knowledge and experience with Python and networked computing • Some C coding experience • Knowledge of development tools like git and Jenkins and agile process • Some experience working in an industrial software-development environment is a plus. Knowledge of network protocols and linux systems is desirable. • Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through UBC Science Co-op Cover Letter Required?
