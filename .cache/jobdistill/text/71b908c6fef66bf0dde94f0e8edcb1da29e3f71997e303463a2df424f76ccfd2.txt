Overview Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers, who pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment. Microsoft Research Asia - Vancouver lab, located in the vibrant city of Vancouver, BC, Canada, our lab represents Microsoft Research Asia's expansion into the Asia-Pacific region. We're on a mission to transform the future of artificial intelligence by bridging the gap between cutting-edge general AI and the specialized, real-world applications that drive meaningful impact. We are seeking multiple Research Interns working on AI-driven System design, advancing and exploring AI-driven methods for the system design with scalability, precision and cost-efficiency. You will be working with MSR researchers across Vancouver lab, Redmond Lab, Beijing lab and beyond to push forward the boundaries of system design and shape the next generation of intelligent systems. We encourage students with diverse research backgrounds, including but not limited to multimodality, system, architecture, AI4Code, NLP, LLM and computer vision, to apply for this position. Responsibilities Research Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world's best researchers, Research Interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Research Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, Research Interns are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other Research Interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.
