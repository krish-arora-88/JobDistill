Skills You'll Need to Bring: • Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck. • Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact-good and bad. • Willingness to learn: If you haven't worked in the SaaS productivity tool space before or have never analyzed an A/B test, you are open to acquiring the necessary domain knowledge and skills to contribute. • Balance work quality and speed: You can deliver high-quality, accurate analyses while recognizing that the goal is to influence business decisions rather than achieve perfect measurement. • Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. • Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same. Nice to Haves: • You have previous intern experience working with product, engineering, or GTM teams. • You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others-and understand why we're big fans of their work.
