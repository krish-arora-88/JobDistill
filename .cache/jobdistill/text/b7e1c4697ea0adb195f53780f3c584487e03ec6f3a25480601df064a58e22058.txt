But this is just the beginning. It takes inventive minds with diverse skills, backgrounds, and cultures to transform 5Gs potential into world-changing technologies and products. This is the Invention Age - and this is where you come in. General Summary: Before there were smartphones or smart cities, before autonomous cars or 360° virtual reality videos, there was our technology. Headquartered in San Diego, for over 30 years Qualcomm inventions have inspired others to make the impossible, possible. From 5G to artificial intelligence, from IoT to automotive and extended reality applications, Qualcomm is inventing the technologies of an intelligently connected future, spearheading research efforts for the next global wireless standard, and collaborating with industry leaders in the wireless value chain to make this future a commercial reality. The field of 2D generative modeling is advancing rapidly, continually expanding the boundaries of image synthesis and manipulation. This internship aims to harness recent breakthroughs, particularly in 2D diffusion models [1, 2], to investigate efficient generative techniques such as few-step distillation [3, 4, 5] and high-resolution image generation [6, 7, 8]. The research will also extend into related areas including image editing, super-resolution, and restoration [9, 10, 11]. Responsibilities: • Research and develop innovative approaches in 2D diffusion models for generative modeling. • Extend research to adjacent tasks, such as super-resolution and image restoration. • Explore and implement more efficient techniques to enhance the performance of generative models, focusing on computational efficiency. • Conduct implementation of baselines for comparative evaluation on benchmarks, along with thorough ablation studies. • The research conducted in this internship is aimed at advancing the field of 2D generative modeling, with the expectation of contributing to paper submissions at top-tier conferences in the field.
