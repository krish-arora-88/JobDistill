With your project you can make a true impact, whether it's external to our customers or internal to Boxers. You will not only learn, grow, and hone your technical skills, but also softer skills. We'll teach you how to build your own personal brand, negotiation techniques, and more through personal and professional development workshops. • Want real world experience? We treat you like a full-time engineer. You'll be immersed on your team and part of the daily standups and other agile practices, getting an opportunity to really see first hand how decisions get made. There is also potential for a full-time offer, so that you can come back after graduation and continue to make an impact with Box. • Want to drive your own career? Our interview process is universal.
