To do so, we have two knowledge sharing products: • Quora: a global knowledge sharing platform with over 400M monthly unique visitors, bringing people together to share insights on various topics and providing a unique platform to learn and connect with others. • Poe: a platform providing millions of global users with one place to chat, explore and build with a wide variety of AI language models (bots), including GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4, Veo 3, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana), and more. As AI capabilities rapidly advance, Poe provides a single platform to instantly integrate and utilize these new models. Behind these products are passionate, collaborative, and high-performing global teams. We have a culture rooted in transparency, idea-sharing, and experimentation that allows us to celebrate success and grow together through meaningful work. Join us on this journey to create a positive impact and make a significant change in the world. This role will be working on our Poe product. About the Team and Role: A Quora internship is not an ordinary internship. There's no busy work. Every project that our interns work on is important to the company and its goals. As a team, we are dedicated to holding high standards, developing a strong and passionate culture, and emphasizing impact. We value building a culture with strong engineering values and goals because we believe that it is the key to building a great company and product. Interns play an important role in this, as they work alongside full-time employees as equals, working on the same projects that help drive the company and product forward. We expect interns to become valuable contributors to the team, as they work hand-in-hand with people ranging from engineering to design to business development. We also realize that mentorship is important to allow interns to grow and develop skills in areas which they're looking to improve. For example, every intern will have a full-time engineer as a mentor, and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and ensure things are going well. We also emphasize code reviews and hold weekly engineering tech talks to maintain high code quality and to optimize for learning the best engineering practices. This internship will run for 16 weeks beginning in January. Responsibilities: • Participate in developing cutting-edge LLM applications including but not limited to information retrieval, search and discovery and agentic coding assistants, ensuring smooth and engaging user experiences. • Participate in a wide variety of Applied AI activities, including refining and optimizing prompting, incorporating new LLM capabilities (such as function calling, tool use, etc) to improve the outcome of LLM. At Quora, we value diversity and inclusivity and welcome individuals from all backgrounds, including marginalized or underrepresented groups in tech, to apply for our job openings. We encourage all candidates who share a passion for growing the world's knowledge, even those who may not strictly meet all the preferred requirements, to apply, as we know that a diverse range of perspectives can have a significant impact on our products and our culture.
