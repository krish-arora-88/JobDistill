We operate in a huge, but overlooked market in a country with the least amount of financial technology innovation in the developed world. Our first act is to become the cheapest and best provider of short-term credit to the 20 million people in Canada who live paycheck to paycheck. More than 600,000 Canadians have already signed up with Bree and we believe we are just scratching the surface. We are in an exciting place where we have product market fit, explosive growth, and a clear path to becoming one of the most important FinTechs in Canada. We are at 8-figures of annualized revenue, growing double-digit monthly, profitable, and have had zero voluntary employee churn. We were part of Y Combinator in 2021 and raised a $2M seed round shortly after. About the Role Bree is building a pragmatic, high-ownership engineering team that ships customer value quickly and calmly. We care less about perfect craft for its own sake and more about impact, reliability, and momentum. You'll own features end-to-end across our Lambda-based backend and React Native apps. You'll make smart assumptions when product specs are thin, be comfortable working around engineering tradeoffs, and iterate fast to get value in customers' hands. You'll pair a builder's mindset with enough testing and observability to keep us moving without breaking things. What You'll Do • Ship full-stack features end-to-end: product discovery, scoping, implementation, and release. • Work across a TypeScript/Node serverless stack (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SQS) and React Native frontends. • Make pragmatic calls in ambiguous situations; unblock yourself and others without waiting on perfect specs. • Instrument what you ship (logging, metrics, alerts) and add tests to keep releases stable. • Improve existing surfaces: refactor opportunistically, pay down tech debt without slowing delivery. Collaborate tightly with design and product on customer-visible outcomes, not theoretical elegance. • Job Requirements What You'll Need • Have real startup experience shipping product in lean environments. • Have shipped things personally (side projects, OSS, indie apps) and can show a portfolio/GitHub. • Are fluent in TypeScript and comfortable across Node, React/React Native, and REST/GraphQL APIs. • • Have worked with AWS serverless (Lambda/SQS) or equivalent event-driven systems. Use testing pragmatically (Jest, React Native Testing Library, Detox) and integrate into CI. • Demonstrate product judgment: you can refine a rough idea into a scoped, high-leverage release. • Communicate clearly, default to ownership, and stay even-keeled when wrestling with engineering tradeoffs. Nice To Have • Experience with mobile release pipelines, over-the-air updates, and app store processes. • Observability chops (e.g., structured logging, tracing, performance profiling). • Comfort with analytics/experimentation (event models, simple A/Bs) to validate features. Contributions to OSS or public write-ups about projects you've shipped. • Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Special Application Instructions Please click the "I intend to apply to this position" button on SCOPE and also submit your application via the employer's website.
