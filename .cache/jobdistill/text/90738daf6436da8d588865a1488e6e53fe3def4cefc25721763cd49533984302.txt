Available internships All of the available internships for Summer 2025 feature innovative, multidisciplinary research projects in the field of CYBERSECURITY. With the rapid evolution of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G, cybersecurity has become a critical issue in all sectors of society. From governments to private companies, from aeronautics to finance to shipping, and from individual users to entire populations of major metropolitan areas, everyone is exposed to the technological and human challenges and growing threats of cyberattacks. Protecting personal data, securing financial transactions, defending critical infrastructures such as power grids and healthcare systems, and preserving the confidentiality of communications are all essential aspects of cybersecurity. Given this context, cybersecurity research plays a crucial role in our society, enabling us to develop new defense technologies, improve existing security protocols, anticipate future attacks and cope with the constant evolution of cybercriminals' tactics. It is necessary not only to protect our infrastructures and data, but also to guarantee the trust and stability of today's interconnected digital society.
