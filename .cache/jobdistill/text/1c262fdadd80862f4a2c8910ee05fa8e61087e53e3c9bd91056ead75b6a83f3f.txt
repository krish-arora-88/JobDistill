But this is just the beginning. It takes inventive minds with diverse skills, backgrounds, and cultures to transform 5Gs potential into world-changing technologies and products. This is the Invention Age - and this is where you come in. We are hiring for the CPU software team...for Telemetry. Telemetry has the same relationship to silicon chips, as feelings have to an animal. Inside the body we have pain receptors, they are the first sign that you have a disease. Without them you'd never know you had an infection until you suddenly die of organ failure. Inside any PC or phone chip we also have sensors and other performance monitors which tell you what the activity, power and thermal levels are inside the chip. The telemetry they generate gives you clues about what is going on inside the chip. Everyone who buys a computer assumes it's already been tuned to peak performance before it was shipped....we're the ones making that happen. Applicants: Qualcomm is an equal opportunity employer.
