About You: • You have relentlessly high standards - many people may think your standards are unreasonably high. You are continually raising the bar and driving those around you to deliver great results. You make sure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed. • You're not bound by convention - your success-and much of the fun-lies in developing new ways to do things • You need action - speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking. • You earn trust - you listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. • You have backbone; disagree, then commit - you can respectfully challenge decisions when you disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. You have conviction and are tenacious. You do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, you commit wholly. • You deliver results - you focus on the key inputs and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, you rise to the occasion and never settle.

Preferred Knowledge and Skills • You catch the details others miss - You test the tester. And then test again. • You don't just report problems-you help solve them • You want to learn how product actually gets shipped, not just brainstormed • You know speed matters - Done is better than perfect, but working is better than broken • You're comfortable asking questions, even if it means uncovering more work You care about the end user, even if you don't directly talk to them. • Why Intern at Sezzle?
