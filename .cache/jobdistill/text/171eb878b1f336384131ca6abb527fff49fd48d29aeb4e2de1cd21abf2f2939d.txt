The student will participate in research within the Echocardiography Laboratory at University Health Network by extracting echocardiographic studies and working with existing large image models in echocardiography to further develop algorithms that can differentiate between ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Using curated datasets from UHN representing specific non-ischemic cardiomyopathy subtypes (for example sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, Fabry disease, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and iron overload cardiomyopathy etc ), the student will attempt to train existing echo models to differentiate etiologies of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, a significant clinical dilemma for cardiologists and heart failure specialists. Educational Objectives: • To learn the basics of echocardiography nomenclature, standard views, and core image acquisition principles. • To expand skills in the use of large image models and related deep learning tools, and to further develop their applications in echocardiography and cardiomyopathy phenotyping. • To work closely with the head of the Toronto General Hospital Echocardiography Laboratory and the lab's Quality lead to gain exposure to Research methodology, including Study design, data curation, and model evaluation. Proposed deliverables at the end of the placement: • Development and preliminary testing of a pilot large image model-based algorithm aimed at differentiating ischemic from non- ischemic cardiomyopathy using echocardiographic data. • Exploratory analyses and models assessing the potential to distinguish between different etiologies of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (for example sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, Fabry disease, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and iron overload) based on echocardiographic features. • Preparation of an abstract and presentation summarizing the project's methods, preliminary findings, and future directions for submission to the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research Summer Research Day. Job Requirements Qualifications • Current undergraduate or medical student in a relevant field (for example: computer science, engineering, data science, medicine, or a related discipline). • Demonstrated experience with Python and PyTorch for machine learning and deep learning projects. • Prior involvement in research projects that apply artificial intelligence to medical imaging modalities (for example: echocardiography, cardiac MRI, CT, or other radiologic imaging). • Foundational understanding of medical AI development workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, validation, and basic performance evaluation. • Strong interest in cardiovascular medicine, echocardiography, and translational applications of AI in clinical care.
