Our Flagship Game: Fruit Golf Ever dreamt of putting a pineapple down a pirate ship while your friends go full sabotage with sharks and exploding barrels? Fruit Golf offers a unique and innovative experience for players of all ages, only requiring one headset for the whole party. Where else can you golf a screaming watermelon down a pirate ship while avoiding sharks and Krakens with your friends? Other golfing games exist in VR and have proved that it is a successful genre of games. Much in the same way Mario Kart has a broader appeal than a racing simulation such as Forza, Fruit Golf takes established rules of a familiar sport and simplifies them while maintaining a fun atmosphere. The award-winning asymmetric multiplayer virtual reality (VR) game Fruit Golf provides a quirky spin on golfing that allows players to be engaged with the game even as spectators. Players take turns putting on the VR headset and playing a round of golf. The players who are not immersed in the headset are still engaged with the game by being able to deploy obstacles to aid or sabotage other players with their connected mobile devices through a companion app on a smartphone or tablet. Our audience will observe how much interactive fun their family members and friends are having and will give an entry point into VR for people that have been previously considering but have not yet made the jump. https://youtu.be/pxXvagDTed4 Join Our Team!
