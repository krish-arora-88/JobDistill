The Provincial Toxicology Centre performs toxicology testing for the BC Coroners Service to identify drugs that may have contributed to death. In recent years, the unregulated drug supply has evolved to include novel psychoactive substances (NPS), which are drugs that are are designed to evade detection and circumvent drug laws. To rapidly identify NPS, we have developed an automated tool using the Bioconductor XCMS package in R. However, this approach has led to a high error rate. We are seeking a co-op student to convert the current R script to a Python script that works with the matchms and spec2vec packages. Job Requirements Knowledge of Python coding is required. Experience with R coding and mass spectrometry data is an asset. Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through UBC Science Co-op Cover Letter Required?
