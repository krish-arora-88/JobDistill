Love Rails? Us too. You get to see how Shopify handles the largest Rails app in the world - and continuously make it better. • Solve problems at a massive scale. Work on complex engineering problems, with full ownership, on products real people use every day. • Ethical by design. Machine learning can make commerce better - and runs the risk of making it worse, too. Carve out how models and algorithms embed in our product to truly support our mission. • Meet our CEO in the code. You'll hear from our CEO, Tobi, regularly. He sets the direction, learns by coding, and is deeply passionate about the details. • Our 4-month Engineering Internships are open to current university students, recent grads, self-taught learners, and career changers. Find out more about our past interns experiences, watch our Intern Diaries video, and read through our Engineering and Data Internships FAQ to help answer any questions you may have about Engineering and Data Internships at Shopify. Being a Shopify Intern: Our hiring process is unique. We match interns to teams we think they'd be successful in and what works best for Shopify. We're looking for: • Applied Machine Learning Engineers to use extensive data to build products and create and fine-tune ML models. • Infrastructure Engineers to build and develop the blocks that move all of Shopify forward. • Security Engineers to detect, evaluate, and address security threats to Shopify and its merchants. • Software Engineers to craft the code that powers commerce, creating the extendable products that scale the entire commerce stack. • Shopify is a big part of the Ruby and Rails communities, and we're constantly improving our codebase to make it even better. You do not need prior Rails experience to apply to this Internship! Working at Shopify: • You must be legally entitled to work in Canada for the entire duration of the Winter 2026 internship (January 5th to April 24th, 2026). Shopify does not provide immigration support to intern candidates at this time. • Our internships are 4 month long, full-time, paid experiences. • As an Intern you must be able to work from one of our three offices: Montréal (490 Rue De la Gauchetière O), Ottawa (151 O'Connor Street), or Toronto (620 King West). Please note: if you don't currently live in Montréal, Ottawa, or Toronto, you must be willing and able to relocate for in-office experiences to the closest Shopify office to you. If successful in your application, we will match you to a team when you start at Shopify. We're unable to accommodate requests for particular teams and location changes once an offer is signed. Onboarding: • Interns must be located in their office city by the first day of Onboarding (January 5th) ready to work 9:00am - 5:00pm. You can't work from outside Canada. About Shopify Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we've grown to over 8,300 employees and generated over $1 trillion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. This is life-defining work that directly impacts people's lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

Before you apply, consider if you can: • Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone • Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth • Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter) • Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change • Bring critical thought and opinion • Use AI tools reflexively as part of your fundamental workflow • Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward Work digital-first for your daily work • Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Cover Letter Required?
