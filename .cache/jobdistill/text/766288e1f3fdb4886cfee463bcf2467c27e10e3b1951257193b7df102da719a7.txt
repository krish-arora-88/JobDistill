Who We Are We build the software that keeps the mining industry running. Our fleet management systems orchestrate hundreds of ultra-class mining trucks (think 400-ton behemoths worth $6M each), optimize their routes, keep operators safe, and literally save our customers millions of dollars per day. When a mine starts their shift, they're trusting our software with their safety and productivity. Our code has evolved over 30 years to become one of the industry's preferred choices. It's battle-tested, commercially successful, and powers operations at massive scale across dozens of mines worldwide. Here's where you come in: We have a treasure trove of proven, profitable software that needs modernization, improvement, and sometimes just understanding. Legacy C++ modules that have run flawlessly for decades but few people remember precisely why they work. Test harnesses that could be invaluable if revived. Documentation that needs translating from "what made sense in 2005" to "what makes sense now." Localization systems ready for a modern approach. Small improvements that, multiplied across our entire install base, create enormous value. This isn't your typical co-op where you'll build a feature that might ship someday. You'll be doing detective and systems thinking on software that's already successful, already critical, and already generating value. You'll learn how robust software truly evolves over decades - not from textbooks, but from code that processes millions of dollars in operations daily. But we won't throw you in the deep end. Universities might not teach you how to understand legacy production systems, learning how to ask the right questions about existing code. What problem were they solving? Who depends on this? What happens if we change it? As you build understanding and confidence, you'll gain more autonomy to identify and pursue your own improvements. We'll give you specific "missions" to solve, tools to investigate with, and mentors to guide your thinking. You'll trace through systems with team members who know their histories. You'll start to identify patterns and opportunities. With regular mentor check- ins, you'll tackle broader investigations and may propose your first improvements to systems that run 24/7. Throughout, you'll have a mentor who meets with you weekly to share the stories behind the code and help you develop investigation instincts that will serve you your entire career. You'll Work With • C++ and C# at the core (including some genuinely vintage C++) • Modern CI/CD pipelines, Gherkin, X-Ray, and contemporary testing frameworks • Bits of TypeScript and Python where they make sense • Hundreds of git repositories (yes, hundreds - each with its own story) • Simulators and test harnesses waiting to be restored to glory A supportive team that knows these systems inside-out and wants to share that knowledge • What Success Looks Like By the end of the term, you'll have: • Mastered the art of reading and understanding existing code (a criminally underrated skill) • Learned how to investigate before you innovate - a crucial ability most developers learn the hard way • Debugged and improved systems where "just rewrite it" isn't an option • Developed intuition for what makes software truly maintainable over decades, not just years Contributed real improvements to software that runs reliably at mine sites globally • What We Offer • The chance to work on software that actually matters • Freedom to explore and improve systems without the pressure of sprint deadlines • The rare opportunity to see how software really evolves over decades in production • The satisfaction of making improvements that will benefit users worldwide Hybrid work schedule with in-office and remote work • The Bottom Line This role is perfect if you want to understand how real software survives and thrives in the real world. You'll touch code that's older than streaming services, work on systems that move mountains (literally), and learn investigation and maintenance skills that most developers don't get until they're years into their careers. We're honest about this role: you'll spend time understanding before you start improving. But if you're the kind of person who wants to know why things work, not just that they work, you'll thrive here. Ready to help us modernize software that powers an entire industry? Wenco advances the efficiency and safety of the world's surface mining equipment through our fleet management systems. We are committed to providing a stable yet exciting work place environment for individual employees to build and grow their career with the Company. Wenco is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
