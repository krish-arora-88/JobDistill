Our technology enables safer development and testing of autonomous vehicles, driver-assistance systems, and robotics. Our team combines deep expertise in machine learning, behavioral modeling, and high-fidelity simulation. About the Role We're looking for multiple Computer Science & Engineering Interns to join our team for an 8-month (or longer) Co-op. You'll be part of a fast-paced, research-driven environment, working on features and pipelines that bridge cutting-edge machine learning research with industry-level products. You will gain hands-on experience in machine learning applications, pipelines and ML operations, while helping us bring realistic, human-like behavior to autonomous driving systems used in simulation platforms. Responsibilities Develop, test, and maintain high-performance software systems that • integrate with our models and toolkits. • Collaborate with engineers and researchers to implement, evaluate, and deploy generative models. • Contribute to backend development, ML pipelines, simulation environments, or infrastructure, depending on your skills and interests. • Participate in technical discussions, code reviews, and documentation. • Explore new frameworks and technologies to improve the reliability and scalability of our systems. What You'll Gain Mentorship from experienced engineers, researchers, and faculty • founders. • Hands-on work on real-world problems in AI and autonomous driving systems. • Exposure to cutting-edge generative modeling and simulation workflows. • An opportunity to directly impact the development of safer autonomous technologies. Job Requirements Qualifications Required: Enrolled in a Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or related degree • program. • Available for a full-time internship of at least 8 months. • Strong coding skills in Python and/or C++ with a solid grasp of core computer science concepts. • Familiarity with version control (Git) and collaborative software development. • Curious, self-driven, and eager to learn in a research and engineering- heavy environment. Preferred: Experience with machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, • TensorFlow), or simulation platforms (e.g., CARLA, Unity, ROS). • Exposure to backend development, containerization (Docker), or cloud infrastructure. • Previous experience in ML modelling, shipping model inferences via APIs and ML application deployment an asset.
