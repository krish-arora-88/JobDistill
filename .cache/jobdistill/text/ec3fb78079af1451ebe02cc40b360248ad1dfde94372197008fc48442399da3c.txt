We believe that GaN power semiconductors have the potential to revolutionize the efficient use of electrical energy. If you are eager to contribute to a sustainable future by generating leading edge innovation, then this is your chance! Job description In this role, you will decisively contribute to the development of our next-generation all-GaN intelligent power module (IPM) technology, ranging from device concept engineering and board-level reliability assessment to production ramp-up. • Hardware Integration Support: Support the integration of a co-packaged Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) module by helping to design and validate the system under high-speed switching conditions. • Firmware and Algorithm Development: Develop and test firmware calibration algorithms for the IPM's temperature compensation strategy. • IC Validation and Testing: Execute high-current double pulse tests (DPTs), 500/1,000-hour power cycling reliability runs, and perform electromagnetic compatibility pre-scans. • Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Assembly: Assemble and solder PCBs, assisted by understanding and following electrical schematics and bills of materials (BOM). Additional Responsibilities: May include device testing, circuit simulation on LTspice, as well as PCB testing and debugging. • Number of working hours per week: 38-40 hours Job Requirements Requirements: • Currently enrolled in a 3rd/4th year program in electrical engineering, computer engineering, engineering physics, or other relevant fields. • Proficiency in programming, preferably in C / C++, for embedded systems. • Prior experience with ADCs and microcontrollers such as the Microchip PIC32 series or TI C2000 series. • Hands-on experience with engineering lab equipment such as oscilloscopes, multimeters, and power supplies. • Behavioral skills such as ability to work well independently, as well as in a team, multitasking, good organizational and documentation skills. Assets: • Experience in semiconductor testing, especially power device characterization, is a strong asset. • Familiarity with circuit simulation tools like LTspice. • Experience with thermal testing or the use of a climatic chamber. Understanding of power electronics topologies and high-voltage Si, SiC, or GaN devices. • N/A Citizenship Requirement APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through UBC Science Co-op Cover Letter Required? Optional Address Cover Letter to Heemal Parimoo Special Application Instructions Please include a portfolio if you have one showcasing relevant projects, professional work, or university coursework.
