The research team is also part of the BC's Gynecologic Cancer Initiative, which is a world-leading, interdisciplinary team working together to drive innovative research that transforms how we prevent, diagnose, treat and improve survivorship care for people with gynecological cancer. This position will support the Rare Ovarian Cancer Collaborative Analytics (ROCCA) Platform, an initiative aimed at advancing research on rare ovarian cancers through an international federated data network, hosted by UBC. The student will play a central role in driving the success of the network by developing and executing distributed and federated data analysis workflows and processes, including federated learning, a machine learning technique that allows for the sharing and analysis of data across different institutions and locations, without having to transfer data. The individual will work in collaboration with Dr. Aline Talhouk's research team with the following key responsibilities: • Develop and run distributed analyses in R using secure, reproducible workflows. • Write clean, well-documented R code for data wrangling, modeling, and summarization. • Package analysis scripts for partner sites, ensuring they run independently and return only approved summary outputs. • Perform data validation and quality control on input and output files. • Combine site-level results through meta-analysis and prepare summary tables and figures. • Maintain reproducible environments using renv and version control (Git). • Document procedures and prepare clear user instructions for site collaborators. • Produce regular progress updates and contribute to report generation using rmarkdown. • Follow privacy and data governance requirements to ensure no individual-level data leaves participating sites. • Research on current landscapes for distributed and federated analysis. • Assist in developing and executing federated learning techniques, which may include implementing technical infrastructure and standard operating procedures to ensure quality and consistency of data analysis. Supervision & Training: • The student will be supervised by the principal investigator and senior lab members (Senior Statistical Analyst and Project Manager). • Job-specific orientation and training will be provided for the project by the principal investigator and senior lab members. • Introduction to past and ongoing research projects in the lab. • The principal investigator will outline specific goals and expectations at the beginning of the work term. • The student will participate in regular check-in meetings with the principal investigator and senior lab members for ongoing communication, evaluation of work, formative feedback, and support. Career Exploration: • Gain skills in statistics and distributed/federated methodologies. • Gain skills working with large, distributed datasets. • Gain skills in effective communication and collaboration. • Opportunity to work independently, take initiative, and set project objectives with the guidance of staff, which will help students with professional and academic growth. Job Requirements • Current upper-level (3rd year and above) undergraduate student in statistics, bioinformatics, computer science, health sciences or related fields. • Strong experience and skills in R and REDCap are preferred. • Experience with advanced statistical modeling (e.g., LLMs, survival analysis, etc.) • Familiarity with open science practices, data sharing, and code documentation. • Experience with data harmonization, federated data systems, or collaborative platforms (e.g., OHDSI, GA4GH, or similar) is a strong asset. • Experience working with rare disease cohorts or cancer consortia. Clear written and verbal communication skills to document findings and present results, and strong attention to detail. • Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through UBC Science Co-op Cover Letter Required?
