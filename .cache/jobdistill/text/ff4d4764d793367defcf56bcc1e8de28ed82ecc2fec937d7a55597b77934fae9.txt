We aren't just building a tool; our platform is a direct reflection of how we choose to work together every day. We foster an environment where ideas and concerns are shared transparently. We empower every member to own their work and hold themselves accountable. We are dedicated to building best-in-class tools to support our community's success, and we are looking for a student developer to help us build the next generation of our platform. The Opportunity We are looking for a motivated Junior Front-End Developer to join our team for a work placement term. You will be reporting directly to a Senior Developer, gaining hands-on mentorship in a production environment. Unlike internships where you might be siloed on a side project, you will be working on our core codebase. You will learn how to write maintainable, production-grade code, understand the importance of testing, and see how a remote engineering team operates. What You Will Do • Write Robust Tests: You will improve the reliability of our platform by writing unit and integration tests using vitest, react-testing- library, and playwright. • Implement Features: You will build small but impactful features using TypeScript and React, styling them with Material UI (MUI) and SASS. • Documentation: You will help maintain internal documentation, ensuring our code is understandable and our processes are clear. • Collaborate: You will participate in code reviews and pair programming sessions, receiving direct feedback on your work to help you improve. The Tech Stack You don't need to be an expert in all of these, but you will be working with: • Core: TypeScript, React • Testing: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright • Styling: Material UI (MUI), SASS • Infrastructure: AWS (especially AppSync and JavaScript resolvers) What You Will Learn • Code Quality: How to write clean, type-safe code that passes strict review standards. • Testing Strategies: Why we test, what to test, and how to use modern testing frameworks. • Cloud Architecture: Exposure to AWS resources, specifically how front-end applications interact with serverless backends (AWS AppSync). • Remote Workflow: How to succeed in a fully remote, distributed team using an Agile-inspired workflow. Why Join Us? • Mentorship: You won't be left alone. You will have regular access to a Senior Developer for guidance and pair programming. • Culture: We value diverse perspectives and treat all colleagues with dignity. We are a small team, which means your contribution actually matters. • Focus on Code: You won't be asked to design UIs in Figma. Your focus will be on logic, implementation, and code quality. • Compensation: The band for this role is 26.00 - 32.00 / hr with full time 37.5 hours per week. Duration is 4 months (17 weeks) with start date of April 1st - May 1st (variable for the right candidate). _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ This position is part of DigiBC's Work Placement Program, which supports post-secondary students by providing experiential learning opportunities in animation, video games, visual effects, and XR.

Job Requirements Who You Are • You own your outcomes. Even as a student, you take pride in managing your commitments. If you say you will do something, you do it, or you communicate early if you hit a roadblock. You are self-motivated and don't need to be micro-managed to stay on track. • You are transparent. You aren't afraid to say "I don't know" or "I made a mistake." You understand that in a remote environment, hiding blockers helps no one, but sharing concerns openly leads to solutions. • You are feedback-hungry. You view code reviews and mentorship not as criticism, but as the fastest way to level up your skills. You are eager to learn best-in-class systems and improve your craft. • You have a foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. • You have experience (academic or personal projects) with React. • You have experience with Git and GitHub. • You are curious about TypeScript and static typing. • You are comfortable communicating in a remote environment.
