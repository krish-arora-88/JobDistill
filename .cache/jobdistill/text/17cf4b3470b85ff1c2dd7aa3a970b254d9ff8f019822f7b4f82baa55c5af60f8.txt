We solve the critical labour shortage for farms by building robots that pick, trim and pack mushrooms. We are a team of builders that like to move fast and embrace the uncertain process of innovation - because every breakthrough comes with a few mistakes along the way. Our robots are already working on six of the world's largest mushroom farms - and this is just the beginning. If you love tech, thrive on innovation, and have a passion for building and bringing it to life in the real world in a commercial space, you'll find your spot here. Join us and help reshape the future of farming with grit, brains, and a team that actually gets things done. About The Role As a Software Co-op Student at 4AG Robotics, you will become an integral part of our software development team. You'll contribute to the design, development, testing, and deployment of software systems that power our robotic harvesters. Whether you're working on back-end architecture, computer vision, robot controls, or user interfaces, your contributions will have a direct impact on our technology and our customers. This is a hands-on role where you will be expected to take initiative, learn quickly, and work collaboratively with teammates across engineering disciplines. What You Will Work On Your responsibilities may include: • Developing and maintaining Typescript-based code for web interfaces or C++ code for robotic/data systems • Collaborating with team members on algorithm development for perception and control • Writing unit tests and performing code reviews to ensure high-quality software • Assisting with integration and testing on real robots in the lab and at farms • Supporting data collection, analysis, and visualization for system improvements • Working with modern development tools including Git and Docker in a Linux environment Participating in daily stand-ups, release planning, and design discussions • What Our Teammates Enjoy. We build robots and deeply appreciate our humans. We move swiftly and expect a lot from each other. We build our work around this. • We value our people. We offer competitive compensation, and depending on your experience, this position has a monthly salary range of $4,333 to $5,373 per month. • We value your time. We support work-life integration that focuses on delivering results, not completing a timesheet. We flex to get the job - and life - done. • We recharge with downtime. A start-up can be a busy place. We encourage all our people to take a vacation on top of statutory holidays. • Collaborate, innovate, have fun - a workplace where your ideas matter, your contributions make an impact, and creativity drives everything we do. We know learning never ends. We support our people in pursuing ongoing development and learning throughout the year. • We support relocation. Moving to a new place for a short time can come at a high financial cost. We offer financial support to our students to help with this.
