With AI redefining the computing paradigm, solutions must evolve to unify innovations in software models, compilers, platforms, networking, and semiconductors. Our diverse team of technologists have developed a high performance RISC-V CPU from scratch, and share a passion for AI and a deep desire to build the best AI platform possible. We value collaboration, curiosity, and a commitment to solving hard problems. We are growing our team and looking for contributors of all seniorities. At Tenstorrent, pre-silicon verification is where architectural vision meets real-world rigor. As a DV Intern, you will work at the heart of our high-performance AI and CPU chiplets-writing tests, finding bugs, and learning what it takes to verify world-class hardware before it hits silicon. You'll collaborate with experienced engineers who live and breathe chip design. This role is full-time and on-site, based out of Ottawa, Canada or Toronto, Ontario What You Will Learn: • How high-performance SoCs and chiplets are verified before tape-out. • Industry-proven verification flows including simulation, emulation, and coverage. • The full DV lifecycle: test planning, debug, execution, and closure. • Collaboration with design, architecture, and performance teams in a real-world chip project. • How AI is playing a significant role in the development of code, tools and flows. Job Requirements Who You Are: • Senior-year undergrad or grad student in EE, CE, CS, or a related field. • Comfortable with C++, SystemVerilog, or scripting languages. • Familiar with computer architecture and interested in how chips really work. Analytical, curious, and ready to dive into the details of performance and functionality. • What We Need: • Develop tests for functional and performance verification of AI/CPU chiplets. • Write and debug RTL, testbenches, and simulation environments. • Support coverage, checkers, and verification infrastructure across subsystems. Help build tooling and workflows that scale across pre-silicon to post-silicon. • Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Special Application Instructions Please click the "I intend to apply to this position" button on SCOPE and also submit your application via the employer's website.
