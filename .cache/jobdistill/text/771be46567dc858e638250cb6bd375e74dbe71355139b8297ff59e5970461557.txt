We're inviting Engineering and CS students and faculty to collaborate on projects at the intersection of photogrammetry, 3D vision, and medical imaging, advancing tools that directly support global skin cancer and dermatology care. Why Get Involved This is more than research, it's meaningful innovation. Your contributions could shape how skin cancer and other dermatological conditions are detected, tracked, and treated across the globe. Perfect for undergrad, Masters and PhD directed studies, projects, or research credit, as well as co-op, part-time, and full-time opportunities. You'll: • Rapidly prototype and evaluate in real-world contexts. • Develop algorithms with tangible clinical impact. • Push the boundaries of 3D vision and AI in healthcare. • Active project tracks • Template fitting for photogrammetry correction • Align reconstructed meshes to canonical templates to correct scale/drift, fill holes, and denoise multi-view geometry. • • Hybrid reconstruction pipeline (Photogrammetry + NeRF/Gaussian splatting → mesh) Build a pipeline that fuses image-based methods with neural fields and exports clean, watertight, metrically accurate surfaces ready for clinical measurement.. • Medical segmentation & longitudinal analytics • Robust 3D segmentation; surface/volume measurement; registration-based tracking; change detection and quantification over time. Non-rigid temporal tracking (deformable ICP + differentiable rendering) for patient-specific change maps and per-vertex growth/shrinkage curves. • Model manipulation for plastic (non-rigid) operations • Constraint-driven mesh/volume editing (ARAP/elastic energy), topology-safe remeshing, smoothing, and Boolean ops-while preserving geometric quality and volume for surgical planning and patient-tailored edits. Job Requirements Who We're Looking For • Proficient in Python/C++ • Experience in computer vision, graphics, or ML Passion for rigorous, clinically relevant evaluation • N/A Citizenship Requirement APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through Employer Website Cover Letter Required?
