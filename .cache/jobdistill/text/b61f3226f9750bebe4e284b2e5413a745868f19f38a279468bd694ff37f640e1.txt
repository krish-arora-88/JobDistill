As a co-op developer, you'll contribute across the software stack- helping deliver new functionality, improve developer tooling, and support the cloud infrastructure that powers Forge Lab. You'll work with experienced engineers across product, cloud, and simulation domains. This is a hands-on role where your work will be reviewed, tested, and integrated into a real production system. Employee Value Proposition (EVP) Purpose Your work will directly support robotics engineers who rely on Forge Lab to simulate and test robotic vision workflows. You'll help accelerate how robotic solutions are developed and deployed. Growth You'll gain experience with modern development practices including full-stack web development, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and developer tooling-all within a fast-paced robotics startup. Motivators You'll be part of a team that values clarity, iteration, and shipping working software. You'll learn how to write production-grade code, contribute to team rituals like sprint planning and code reviews, and see your work make a tangible difference. Major Objectives 1. Ship a Full-Stack Feature by Mid-Term Within the first 8-10 weeks, collaborate on a small but meaningful feature-from ticket breakdown and UI mock-ups to API integration and deployment. Success is measured by quality, user experience, and test coverage. [Tech: React, Python, FastAPI, GitHub] 2. Improve Developer Workflow or Test Coverage Identify a pain point in the development or testing workflow and propose a solution (e.g., test automation, build script improvement, better error logging). Aim to implement and document the improvement by the end of the term. [Tech: GitHub Actions, Pytest, Docker] 3. Contribute to Cloud Deployment Reliability Support the maintenance of cloud infrastructure by helping monitor logs, address deployment issues, or improve scripts related to container builds or service health. [Tech: AWS, Docker, CloudWatch] Critical Subtasks • Participate in sprint planning, stand-ups, and code reviews. • Break down feature requests into tasks with guidance from mentors. • Implement and test UI components in React, integrating with backend APIs. • Write and run unit/integration tests for new features. • Help reproduce and debug user-facing issues in test environments. Document what you build for future co-ops and developers. • Culture and Situation Fit Apera Forge Lab is built by a tight-knit, collaborative team that values clarity, simplicity, and learning by doing. You'll fit well if: • You're eager to contribute and ready to learn by shipping real code. • You enjoy solving technical problems and working across the stack. You're comfortable asking questions and sharing your progress. • Job Requirements Required Qualifications • Experience with either Python or React through coursework or projects. • Familiarity with Git and basic web development practices. A desire to work with cloud-hosted applications and modern DevOps tooling. • Bonus Experience (Not Required) • Experience with AWS or Docker. • Exposure to robotics, 3D graphics, or simulation environments.
