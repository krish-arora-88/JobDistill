This is a developer-first role embedded within the QA/Test organization. Your work will directly impact how product and engineering teams build, test, and release high-quality software through scalable tooling and infrastructure. You will help design and implement internal tools, services, and platforms that accelerate development velocity, improve test coverage, and reduce manual QA overhead. You will work across the stack to build and enhance our test automation ecosystem through impactful, code-driven contributions. What You Will Do • Design and develop internal tools and frameworks that enhance testing workflows, CI/CD efficiency, and developer experience. • Developing automation frameworks and writing reliable, maintainable functional tests for web applications and services. • Design and develop frontend tools using React or Vue to visualize test results, manage assets, and simplify debugging workflows. • Contribute to backend services, utilities, and automation frameworks that support scalable and reliable testing. • Work with test data, execution logs, and reporting systems to create actionable insights for developers and QA engineers. • Investigate test failures by tracing logs and system behavior, and implement fixes at the infrastructure level, not just within test code. • Collaborate with QA, DevOps, and product teams to identify friction points and develop platform-level solutions. What We Are Looking For • Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field. • Strong proficiency in at least one programming language (Java, JavaScript, or TypeScript preferred). • Familiarity with backend services, CI/CD pipelines, and version control (Git, Bitbucket, Jenkins). • Exposure to building or maintaining web apps using modern frameworks like React or Vue. • Exposure to backend development, CI/CD pipelines, and version control systems like Git. • Understanding of test infrastructure, automation strategies, and QA concepts. • Strong understanding about debugging code. • Ability to analyze logs, trace system behavior, and debug issues in code across services. • Excellent verbal and written communication skills. • Strong collaboration mindset for working across engineering and QA teams. Additional Qualifications • Hands-on experience with Playwright, Cypress, JUnit, or other test frameworks (even if from side projects). • Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), Docker, or observability tooling. • Interest in developer tooling, platform engineering, or test infrastructure. Why Join Us? You will join a mission-critical engineering team focused on enabling speed, reliability, and confidence across product and QA teams. This internship is an opportunity to build real-world systems, ship impactful tooling, and gain mentorship while exploring a technical career at the intersection of software engineering and quality at scale.
