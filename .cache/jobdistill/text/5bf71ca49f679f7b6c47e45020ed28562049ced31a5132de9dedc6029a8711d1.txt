Amidst a growing mental health crisis, clinicians face a significant burden from administrative tasks, which detracts from direct patient care. PAC is developing tools that leverage local Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate clinical documentation, assist in diagnostic interviews, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The focus on local models is critical for preserving privacy. The successful candidate will play a key role in the development, testing, and refinement of these innovative tools. This is a unique opportunity to work with a multidisciplinary team of data scientists, neuroscientists, and psychiatrists, contributing to a project with real-world impact on mental healthcare in Canada. Working with the PAC team, the successful candidate's responsibilities will include: 1. Develop and implement scripts to automate interactions with local Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as clinical note generation and structured interviews. 2. Design and execute evaluation pipelines to assess the quality, accuracy, and safety of LLM-generated outputs, comparing them against clinical gold standards. 3. 4. 5. Maintain clear and organized code using version control (Git) and contribute to the project's technical documentation. Collaborate with the team to troubleshoot technical challenges and refine the architecture of our current tool suite. Assist with related data analysis tasks, which may include supporting projects involving human brain imaging data to explore future multi-modal AI applications. Expected to report regularly to the PAC technical lead and present their progress to the group during their internship. Job Requirements Qualifications: Key Skills: Python, Git, Neural Networks, Large Language Models (LLMs) The ideal candidate will have strong computer experience and a passion for applying technology to solve complex problems. Required: • Strong programming experience in Python. • Solid understanding of and experience with version control using Git. • Familiarity with deep learning concepts and experience running neural network models. A keen interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and their practical applications. • Assets: • Experience with deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch). • Experience with web frameworks (e.g., Django) or data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy). Familiarity with neuroimaging analysis packages (e.g., Nipype, FSL, SPM). • Personal Attributes: • Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently. • Strong interpersonal and communication skills for collaborating within a diverse team. A genuine interest in the intersection of technology and mental health. • Citizenship Requirement N/A APPLICATION INFORMATION Application Procedure Through UBC Science Co-op Cover Letter Required?
