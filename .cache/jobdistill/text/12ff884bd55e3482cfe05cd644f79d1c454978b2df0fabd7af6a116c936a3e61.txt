Current research in neuroscience involves ever increasing amounts of data and future research projects involving next-gen optical and other types of recording systems will push researchers into the petabyte regime. Researchers are increasingly required to provide access to the original data as well as processing code needed to produce the analysis and figures in their publications. This necessitates not only the availability of the IT infrastructure to accommodate the data and code, but the coding know-how to make the analysis transparent and accessible to other scientists. Working with the Dynamic Brain Circuits Cluster Coordinator the successful candidate will- 1. Support (as needed) cluster labs in adopting suggested practices in the Cluster's Data Management White Paper (https://ubcbraincircuits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 2. Help to increase the use of Digital Research Alliance of Canada resources (and UBC ARC resources [sockeye, chinook] as appropriate) by assisting labs with onboarding (in-person assistance as well as potential online video or other resources). Aid in developing Digital Research Alliance resource applications (RAS, RAC, and RRG as appropriate) in consultation with UBC ARC. 3. Work with team members to design workshops and accompanying learning material which demonstrate open workflows for multimodal data. 4. Support on-going Brain Circuits Cluster projects including collaborative efforts with the DMCBH Open Science Initiative, UBC Genes, Cells and Circuits, and the Psychiatry AI Collaboration . 5. Assist in the completion of other related cluster outcomes as required. Job Requirements A variety of skills are required, including: • Strong computer experience and preferably experience in computer programming languages, including python, R and MATLAB. • Strong interpersonal skills and ability to work in a team is needed as the successful student will be expected to interact with graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and the Cluster faculty members. • It is expected that this student will regularly report to the Cluster Coordinator and Cluster Lead, will give at least 2 presentations to the group over the internship period, and write a paper summarizing the work done.
