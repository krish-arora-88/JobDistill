Reports to About Us Chief Executive Officer Our business Flashana Technologies Inc. develops software products in the area of retail supply chain, specifically predictive analytics for inventory management. A poorly maintained inventory is every retailer's worst nightmare. Not only does it lead to a loss in sales over time but also represents a poor indicator of inadequate demand for a product. Questions like what to store, what to discard and when to do so can all be answered. No business wants to hold on to products that are not yielding any sales and every retailer wants to keep replenished stocks of items that are popular with consumers. Predictive analytics remove the need to buy and remove stocks of products on a hunch. Our technology is a demand forecasting model that aims to predict the demand of customers/consumers, of vendor/reseller. Example target markets are alcohol beverage products, consumer retail clothing and the transportation parts industries. It analyzes statistical data and looks for patterns and correlations. Machine learning is applied to determine how the accuracy can be improved over existing statistical methods, such as Fourier Regression Analysis which is commonly used in retail demand chain management.
