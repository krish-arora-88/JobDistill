Job Title: Co-op, Telematics Full Stack Developer (Acheson)

Job ID: 2025-15940

Position Scope

The Engineering Coop Program within North American Construction Group will provide you with valuable exposure to heavy

equipment reliability/maintenance engineering.

We are currently looking to hire a Telematics Systems Analyst student for our co-op program based out of our Acheson office,

located 10 minutes west of Edmonton. To be considered, you must be currently working towards your Mechanical Engineering

Degree, other Engineering disciplines will be considered.

Our Acheson location houses both our head office, on the upper level and our maintenance shop, on the ground floor. The shop is

our main coordination point for the maintenance of the NACG owned and operated fleet. NACG owns over 600 pieces of heavy

equipment including hydraulic shovels, excavators, haul trucks, dozers, graders, articulating trucks, skid steers and other types of

heavy equipment.

NACG is in the process of implementing a world-class telematics system across its fleet of heavy equipment. The telematics

system monitors real-time sensor data from each piece of equipment, tags it with GPS data and sends it to a centralized server

where it is actively monitored by condition monitoring analysts. The system captures data like engine speed, coolant temperature,

oil pressure, operator inputs, payloads and other data streams along with fault codes. The data helps the condition monitoring

analysts understand the overall health and operating conditions of the piece of equipment so they can use engineering judgement

to make data-based decisions to improve component health.

We are recruiting for our future leaders!

North American is proud to have hired many graduating students from our co-op program. Our co-op program is not only a great

way to gain invaluable experience but to hopefully, one day, return as a permanent employee within the NACG team!

We encourage growth and development for students entering today's workforce.
