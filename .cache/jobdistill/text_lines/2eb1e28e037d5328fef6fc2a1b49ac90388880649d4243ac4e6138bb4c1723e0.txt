and supporting our full-system emulator and hybrid hardware-in-the-loop setups.

A successful intern candidate will be able to work with our team but also make independent progress on a project improving our

emulator. Multiple projects are possible, so a candidate will need to select a project to work to their strengths in prototyping,

implementing, and deploying a software project. A deep sense of shared responsibility and shared reward is required, as is the

ability to make work fun and interesting

Essential Job Duties

•

Expanding the functionality of the internal da Vinci emulator, which might be user interface, microcontroller simulation, Linux

kernel module support, or virtualization efforts, depending on candidate background.

•

Learn and practice our team's methodology for developing, deploying, and supporting an internal tool within the Intuitive

engineering organization.

•

Continually communicate with engineers outside of our group throughout the course of the internship.

Qualifications
Required Skills and Experience

•

Working experience with C++ or Python (preference will be given to candidates who can demonstrate ability in both languages.)

•

Experience on a software project lasting at least three months. (You will be expected to present on this existing project during

hiring.)

•

University Enrollment: Must be currently enrolled in and returning to an accredited degree-seeking academic program in the Fall.

•

Internship Work Period: Must be available to work full-time (approximately 40 hours per week) during a 10-12 week period starting

May or June. Specific start dates are shared during the recruiting process.

Required Education and Training

•

Current enrollment in any degree-seeking program which includes some software development (Computer Science, Computer

Engineering, but Electrical Engineer if software electives are present) coursework at the Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate level.
