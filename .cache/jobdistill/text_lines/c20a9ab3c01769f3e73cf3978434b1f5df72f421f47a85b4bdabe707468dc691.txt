Position: Embedded Test Engineer Co-op

Department: EndoBU - R&D Test

General Description:

You will be joining Stryker Endoscopy's R&D Test team. We partner closely with Design & Development to experiment with early

prototypes and vet out products throughout the design process. What this really means, is we get to be the Mythbusters of our

division. Just like the show, we quickly design, build, and code fixtures or scripts to simulate real life situations. This

experimentation is mission critical so we find the issues when we can solve them and prevent them from impacting our customers

and ultimately patients. You will directly be making healthcare better.

As an Embedded Software Test Engineer Co-op, we'll need you to consider the software, firmware, and hardware together. Many

of our products have a limited user interface, so you'll need to use the command line, log files, and physically probe to test the

system. In addition to this hands-on test development and automation, you will also contribute to design verification for the SW/FW

on the product: from the test plan, writing protocols and test cases, presenting defects, and ultimately writing test reports that are

included in regulatory submissions. Communication and coordination are essential skills as you will share and/or coordinate

samples, test execution, test results, and timelines with a cross-functional project team. As part of the co-op program, you'll be

paired with an onsite technical mentor and gain exposure to the full product development cycle.

Team description

In addition to your project team, you will be a part of Endoscopy's R&D Test team. We are a diverse, close-knit team of twenty-five

engineers, specialists, and managers. Our experience ranges from <1 year to 35+ with technical specialties including sterilization

reliability, mechanical, electrical, software, and optics. Our team is located in Burnaby, BC, San Jose, CA, and Flower Mound, TX

with additional partners around the globe. We are often described as hard-working, analytical, and collaborative by others. If this

sounds like you and you have the magic ability to break things - we want you!
